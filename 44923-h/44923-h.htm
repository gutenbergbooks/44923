<div>
<h2 id='ch01' class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chapter One</span><br /> <br />On the Sky High Trail</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The rugged peaks of the Cajons cast deepening
shadows down their eastern slopes as the July
sun, a ball of fire in a cloudless sky, swung
toward the horizon.</p>

<p>Threading his way carefully through one of
the passes of the Cajons was a cowboy on a
sorrel horse. Dust lay thick on both horse and
rider, for they had been long on the trail that
day and there had been no rain in the Cajon
country for weeks.</p>

<p>Breasting the last steep grade leading to the
summit of the pass, a new country was unfolded.
The sorrell paused as its rider dismounted
more than a little stiff from the hours
in the saddle and the intense heat of the day.</p>

<p>The cowboy patted the sorrel affectionately.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long grind, Lightning, old girl.
We’ll rest here a few minutes and then see if
we can find a good place to camp tonight.”</p>

<p>The narrow trail had broadened at the
summit and there was a swale with a little
grass that had escaped the burning rays of the
midsummer heat.</p>

<p>The sorrel began to graze while the cowboy
sat down in the shadows of a boulder.</p>

<p>All day long horse and rider had been toiling
up the slope from the east, following the
little-used trail. Shading his eyes, the cowboy
tried to follow the trail. It turned west
and north, into a country that was well
timbered and appeared to be rich in grazing
land--a country new to both horse and rider.</p>

<p>For the twentieth time in the last three days
the cowboy slipped his hand into an inner
pocket and drew forth an envelope. He unfolded
the letter it contained and scanned it
with puzzled eyes. It was addressed to Slim
Evans, Flying Arrow Ranch, Sunfield, Wyo.</p>

<p>“Dear Slim,” the letter began, “I am in need
of your help. Things are going badly in the
Creeping Shadows country over beyond the
Cajons and I am counting on you to straighten
out the trouble. The greatest secrecy is necessary
so let no one except your father know of
this message. Meet me on the 22nd at the foot
of the Sky High trail on the other side of the
Cajons. Will explain everything then.”</p>

<p>The message was signed by Bill Needham,
secretary of the Mountain States Cattlemen’s
Association.</p>

<p>Slim Evans folded the letter and slipped it
back into the envelope, which was now badly
creased.</p>

<p>It had been a summons he could not disregard
and the mysterious tone of the letter had
aroused his curiosity. Once or twice in the
last two years he had been able to help Bill
Needham and the Mountain States Association
in running down rustlers. Bill was an old
friend of the Evans family and Slim had
hastened to roll his duffel and start for the Sky
High trail over the Cajons.</p>

<p>It was the best part of another day’s ride to
the foot of the trail, but he could slacken the
fast pace he and Lightning had maintained
for he was well within the time limit.</p>

<p>Fine lines puckered Slim’s brow as he stared
down from the summit of the trail toward the
Creeping Shadows country. Although less
than a hundred and fifty miles from the Flying
Arrow, where he had been reared, it was new
country to him, right against the southern
boundary of Montana with the Bad Lands
touching it on the east.</p>

<p>Slim wondered if Needham was calling him
in on a case of cattle rustling. But that seemed
hardly possible, for the association had a small
staff of men who devoted all of their time and
energy to running down cattle thieves. Slim’s
only work along that line had been several
small investigations near the home ranch where
he had been able to save the association the expense
of sending out one of its staff detectives.</p>

<p>Bill Needham was the only man with the
answer and Slim reluctantly left the cool
shadow of the rock. Lightning responded to
his whistle and the cowboy swung into the saddle.</p>

<p>“Half an hour more, Lightning, and we’ll
look for a camp,” said Slim, running his fingers
through the mane of his mount.</p>

<p>Lightning, a beautiful horse, was tall, well
built, with legs strong enough to stand a terrific
speed even in the roughness of the cow
country.</p>

<p>A white star stood out on her forehead and
each foot had a collar of white just above the
fetlock. It was evident that horse and rider
understood each other for, from time to time,
Slim spoke to Lightning and the mare seemed
to nod in reply.</p>

<p>The Sky High trail had been in little use for
half a dozen years, the new trail through the
Cajons went nine miles south along an easier
pass. Years before the Sky High trail had been
one of the main routes through the mountains,
cowboys and herds from the Creeping Shadows
country thundering along it. Now the old
road was covered with weeds and only a semblance
of a trail remained.</p>

<p>For half an hour Slim and Lightning swung
down from the summit at a steady pace. The
trail rounded a rocky promontory and a small
patch of timber ahead hinted of a suitable
camping place.</p>

<p>A mountain stream, grown thin from lack
of rain, stumbled along over its rocky bed.
There was enough grass and plenty of shelter.
Slim dismounted, loosened the cinches, and
pulled the heavy saddle and blanket from
Lightning’s back. He slipped the bit out of
the sorrel’s mouth, tossed the reins over the
magnificent head, and Lightning was free to
graze for whatever morsels of grass could be
found in the little valley.</p>

<p>Slim unfastened the slender duffel roll he
carried behind the saddle and brought out the
mess kit. He was traveling light.</p>

<p>Before preparing his own evening meal, he
slipped off the well-worn leather chaps which
protected his legs and went down to the little
stream. The water was cool and sweet and he
drank deeply from the hurrying creek. Then
he washed thoroughly, finally dousing his head
in the water.</p>

<p>When he cleared the water from his eyes he
saw Lightning standing a little below him and
looking at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>Slim laughed. “Better try a little water to
wash off the dirt,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>But Lightning snorted disdainfully, drank
deeply, and returned to graze again.</p>

<p>The cool water refreshed Slim greatly and he
set about the task of preparing his evening
meal. There was still a half hour of daylight,
but he had been in the saddle at sun-up and,
toughened though he was to the life of the
range, the heat had tired him. He was ready to
roll into his blanket as soon as he finished his
meal.</p>

<p>There was plenty of dry wood in the patch
of timber and Slim soon had a small, smokeless
fire going. Plenty of bacon, bread that now
was none too fresh, and a small pot of coffee
completed food for supper.</p>

<p>Slim had just finished turning the bacon to
a crisp, delicious brown, and the coffee was simmering
in the coals when a rifle shot echoed
from below.</p>

<p>The cowboy paused, bacon halfway between
his tin plate and his mouth. There was another
shot, followed by a fusillade. Slim heard the
sudden scream of pain of a mortally wounded
horse and he finished the bacon in one gulp.</p>

<p>“Lightning!” he called.</p>

<p>The sorrel, now a hundred yards away, heard
the cry and came at a full gallop.</p>

<p>Slim leaped across the campfire and dove
into the small pile of duffel beside his saddle.
From a saddlebag he drew a cartridge belt and
holster. This he buckled swiftly around his
waist, pausing only long enough to make sure
that the heavy .38 in the holster was free.</p>

<p>From a boot fastened to the saddle he drew
a Winchester 30-30. A glance told him that
the magazine was full and he swung an extra
belt of ammunition over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The firing down below was coming steadily.
There was no time to saddle and Slim leaped
upon Lightning and went dashing down the
Sky High trail.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch02' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Two</span><br /> <br />Bushwhackers</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At a mad gallop, Slim and Lightning raced
down the valley. Like the true cow horse,
Lightning sensed obstacles almost before they
were in sight and on more than one occasion
stretched her long legs to leap across badly
washed places in the trail. At the pace they
were going, a tumble would have been fatal
for both.</p>

<p>The valley broadened and the timber thinned
out. Slim reined Lightning in sharply. Ahead
of them was a great wash strewn with boulders
which had been carried down from the peaks of
the Cajons by spring torrents. Somewhere in
the mass of boulders was the secret of the steady
firing.</p>

<p>Slim listened carefully. Three rifles were
barking their song of death. As nearly as he
could tell from the firing, it was two against
one and he voted himself a ringside seat.</p>

<p>“You stay here,” he told Lightning. “I
can’t tell what I’m up against and you’re a
pretty good sized target.”</p>

<p>He slipped off the sorrel and ducked in between
the boulders. The sky was a blaze of red
as the sun dipped over the horizon. Already
the shadows were creeping up from the lowlands.
Another fifteen minutes at the most remained
of light in which he could hope to do
any kind of shooting if he found himself in
trouble.</p>

<p>Slim moved from boulder to boulder, drawing
rapidly nearer to the scene of the firing. It
seemed to be concentrated to his right and he
worked steadily in that direction. A minute
later he saw the opening of a small draw off the
main valley. Then he spotted the horse which
had been shot down. The animal was lying
just in front of the smaller valley. There was
a huge boulder a little to Slim’s left and he managed
to crawl on top of it. From this point
of vantage the entire scene unfolded.</p>

<p>The rider of the dead horse was trapped in
the small wash. His cayuse shot down, he had
attempted to escape, only to find himself in a
box-like canyon with walls too steep to scale.
He had taken refuge behind the rocks and now
was firing carefully and methodically at the
men who had brought him down.</p>

<p>A few seconds later Slim spotted the riflemen
who had killed the horse. One on each
side, they were gradually closing in on the man
who was trapped in the canyon.</p>

<p>Slim took another look at his Winchester.
The range was almost too easy, less than two
hundred yards. There was no wind, but the
light was fading fast.</p>

<p>He didn’t like the way the men were closing
in on the trapped rider. Their actions were too
deadly, they were firing too calmly. It was
evident that they did not intend that their victim
should get out alive. It wasn’t a fair fight
and Slim took a substantial interest in the argument
as he snuggled the smooth, walnut butt
of the Winchester against his cheek.</p>

<p>With keen eye and steady fingers, he drew a
bead on the nearest rifleman. But the man’s
back was toward him. He couldn’t shoot
without warning. Slim relaxed slightly and
sent a ringing call echoing over the valley.</p>

<p>“Hi-yuh! Hi-yuh! What’s going on
there?”</p>

<p>The firing ceased abruptly and two astonished
riflemen swung toward him, their
weapons ready for instant action. But Slim,
sprawled atop the big boulder, was practically
invisible at that distance. There was no sound
from the man trapped in the canyon.</p>

<p>“What’s going on here?” Slim shouted again.</p>

<p>He must have raised his head slightly, for one
of the riflemen made a snap shot and a bullet
splattered on the boulder less than three feet
away.</p>

<p>That was a declaration of war and Slim accepted
the challenge. He could have shot the
others down in cold blood, but he had given
them a chance--two chances.</p>

<p>The shot fired at Slim was still echoing over
the valley when the cowboy from the Flying
Arrow fired twice. There was a sharp cry of
pain from one of the riflemen and Slim heard
a gun clatter to the rocks. He had aimed for
an elbow which had appeared for just a second
around one side of a boulder. Evidently his
aim had been true.</p>

<p>The man trapped in the canyon had joined
in the fight again and the riflemen were caught
between two fires, with Slim on the one side and
the unknown on the other. They had little desire
to expose themselves to the deadly marksmanship
of Slim and were content to wait until
darkness.</p>

<p>Slim held up his own fire. It was a waste of
lead to blaze away recklessly and the chances
of hitting anyone were extremely remote.</p>

<p>The twilight deepened and the evening star
peeped down on the boulder-strewn wash
which a few minutes before had hummed with
leaden death.</p>

<p>Night came and with it the valley awoke to
new sounds--the noise of boots scraping on
rocks as their wearers clumsily attempted to
move about in silence. Slim took off his own
boots and in his stocking feet started quietly
toward the place where he had last seen the
riflemen. Sharp stones jabbed his feet, but he
moved silently, pressing steadily ahead.</p>

<p>In a few more minutes a new moon would
shed its feeble rays over the Cajons, but it
might not penetrate this remote valley. Slim
almost stumbled over the rifle, which the man
had dropped. The stock of the weapon had
been shattered by the impact of his bullet and
the gun was worthless. Slim laid it back on the
ground and worked slowly toward the mouth
of the box canyon. He was curious to learn the
identity of the man who had been the target
for the vicious attack of the gunmen.</p>

<p>The Flying Arrow cowboy was almost at
the mouth of the canyon when a thunder of
flying hoofs stopped him. There was something
familiar in the leaping cadence. The
wild tattoo of the hoofs sounded like Lightning.
But that couldn’t be. He had left
Lightning well up the trail.</p>

<p>With a growing fear in his heart, Slim cast
caution to the winds and raced back along the
trail. The rocks bruised his feet, but with
his one thought for Lightning there was no
time to stop and hunt for the boulder on which
he had left his boots.</p>

<p>The trail smoothed out. Slim felt grass
underneath. It was here that he had left the
beautiful sorrel; it was here that Lightning
should be waiting for him.</p>

<p>Slim cupped his hands and called the name of
his horse.</p>

<p>“Lightning!” he cried. Over and over again
the shout was hurled from his anxious lips. He
whistled again and again. Each time there was
only the silence of the night for an answer,
while far down the trail the drumming of flying hoofs
lessened and finally vanished altogether.</p>

<p>Slim knew what had happened. The riflemen,
cut off from their own horses by his appearance,
had been forced to seek escape up the
trail. They had come upon Lightning, awaiting
the return of her master, and had mounted
the big sorrel. Picking their way around the
rock-strewn wash, they had returned to their
own horses and made good their escape but
Lightning, the most valuable horse in the Flying
Arrow remuda, had been taken with them.</p>

<p>There was a consuming bitterness in Slim’s
heart as he turned slowly back along the rocky
trail to find his boots. Lightning was his own
horse. He had trained the mare until she was
the envy of every cowboy in the Flying Arrow
territory. His hands gripped the stock of the
rifle hard. Let him come within range of the
men who had stolen Lightning and there would
be no warning shouts, no fancy shots aimed
only to hit an elbow.</p>

<p>It was in such a mood that Slim stormed
back along the trail, too angry to spare his feet
as he walked over the cruel rocks.</p>

<p>A quiet voice brought him back from wild
rage to a cool realization that he was in a tight
spot.</p>

<p>“Put up your hands and don’t move!”</p>

<p>The words were softly spoken, hardly above
a whisper but there was a ring of earnestness
in them that brooked no meddling.</p>

<p>Slim opened his hands and his rifle clattered
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Now raise your arms slowly. Don’t make
a move for the gun in your holster. I’ll drop
you without mercy if you do.”</p>

<p>Carefully Slim’s hands went higher until
they were above his head. His mind worked
rapidly. Could only one of the riflemen have
escaped? Had the unwounded man waited for
him to walk into a trap? Or was this the man
who had been trapped in the canyon?</p>

<p>The questions raced through his mind. The
mysterious letter from Bill Needham of the
Cattlemen’s Association had certainly led him
into a peck of trouble and he hadn’t reached the
Creeping Shadows country.</p>

<p>The soft voice spoke again.</p>

<p>“Turn around now. Move slowly. Remember,
I’ve got you covered.”</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch03' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Three</span><br /> <br />The Strange Letter</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim, his hands reaching toward the heavens,
turned slowly around in the moonlight. He
was careful to make no false move for the bitterness
in the voice of his unknown captor almost
cut the night air.</p>

<p>The rays of the thin moon shone full on
Slim’s face. The other man was hidden in the
shadows, but Slim knew that a gun was trained
on the middle of his body. He waited patiently.
There was a snort of disgust from the
unseen gunman.</p>

<p>“You can let your hands drop. I’ve got the
wrong one. Just my luck.”</p>

<p>Afraid of a trick, Slim was slow in lowering
his hands but once they were at waist level he
felt safe. His revolver was still in the holster
at his side and in a move almost too fast for the
eye to follow he could draw the gun and fire
with amazing rapidity and accuracy.</p>

<p>Shoes scraped over rocks and a form loomed
out of the shadows. Then the moonlight revealed
a youth about Slim’s own age. A rifle was
cradled in one arm.</p>

<p>“Looks like we’re a fine pair,” chuckled the
newcomer. “After you saved my hide from
the skunks who tried to ambush me I turn
around and show my gratitude by bushwhacking
you. Darned wonder someone didn’t get
killed in here tonight.”</p>

<p>“Who are you and what do you want?”
snapped Slim, his anger still near the boiling
point.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you for being a mite peevish,”
said the stocky cowboy. “Matter of fact,
I don’t know altogether what has happened.”</p>

<p>“Who shot your horse down?”</p>

<p>“That’s another mystery. I was taking it
easy down the trail when a rifle cracked and my
horse just folded up and pitched me off. The
old cayuse never knew what hit him. Then
the lead started pouring my way and I scuttled
into that blind canyon.”</p>

<p>“About that time I came along and voted
myself a hand,” put in Slim.</p>

<p>“That’s about right. You cut in just in
time to save my hide. I’m mighty grateful
for what you did and doggone sorry that I held
you up a few minutes ago. After what had
happened I wasn’t going to take any chances.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t blame you for that a whole lot.”</p>

<p>“My name’s ‘Chuck’ Meade,” the newcomer
volunteered. “I’m off the Circle Four. It’s a
little better than a hundred miles south of here
on the Sweetwater.”</p>

<p>“I’m Slim Evans. Home brand is the Flying
Arrow over near Sunfield.”</p>

<p>They coolly looked each other over and an
almost instant liking was struck up between
them.</p>

<p>Slim was tall, as his name implied. A little
better than five feet eleven inches, he packed
163 pounds on a frame that was built of sinewy
muscle. His hands were long and slender and
there was the grace of a mountain lion in his
walk. His blue eyes were frank and inquiring,
but at times a deadly light flickered in them, a
light that warned an opponent that here indeed
was a cow hand who could take care of himself
in almost any emergency.</p>

<p>Chuck tipped the beams at 195 pounds and
stood only five feet seven with his boots on.
His shoulders were massive and his short arms
had the power of a grizzly bear. He was
champion of all wrestlers in the Sweetwater
valley and at catch-as-catch-can scrapping was
without a peer. A mop of curly hair was inclined
to scatter in almost every direction and
his eyebrows were heavy. But under the bushy
brows gleamed brown eyes that were warm
and friendly and he had a likeable smile.</p>

<p>Chuck looked down at the tattered socks on
Slim’s feet.</p>

<p>“This is a bad place to go wandering around
in your stocking feet,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I left my boots down the valley,” Slim explained.
“Figured that in my stocking feet I
could creep up on the two fellows who were
trying to bushwhack you. They got away
from me and stole my horse.”</p>

<p>“What!” exploded Chuck, quick anger
darkening his face.</p>

<p>“While I was playing good Samaritan, those
fellows doubled around behind me and made
away with my horse.”</p>

<p>“That’s tough. Means we’re both on foot,
for my old cayuse will never buck again.”</p>

<p>“Standing here won’t get us any place.
Let’s get my boots.”</p>

<p>Slim picked up his rifle and led the way over
the rocky ground. Every step pained him and
there was little left of his socks when he finally
reached the huge boulder where he had cached
his boots.</p>

<p>He sat down and stripped off his socks, rubbing
his aching feet with his hands.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a change of socks in my blanket
roll,” said Chuck. “I’ll slide over and get my
stuff.”</p>

<p>Slim massaged the soles of his feet until
Chuck returned with his bedroll. The cowboy
from the Circle Four unrolled it and
brought out a pair of heavy, serviceable socks.</p>

<p>Slim drew them on gratefully, wiggled his
toes in comfort, and then slid his feet into his
boots.</p>

<p>“Now I’m ready for action,” he said, standing
up.</p>

<p>“Where you heading?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“Down the Sky High trail,” replied Slim,
who in spite of his liking for his new-found
companion was cautious not to give away any
essential information.</p>

<p>“That’s fine. I’m heading the same way.
Since we’re both going to hoof it from now on,
we might as well throw in together.”</p>

<p>“Suits me,” agreed Slim. “If those boys
who took a little target practice at you should
show up again they may be surprised to find
they’ve got two instead of one to fight.”</p>

<p>Chuck surveyed the heavy gun and the well
worn holster at Slim’s side. He whistled softly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hunch that in a pinch you’d be
right handy with that six gun.”</p>

<p>“I can make it speak a piece,” admitted Slim.
“What about your saddle?”</p>

<p>“It’s just on the other side of the trail. I’ll
pick it up when we start down.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go up to my camp. I was just
sitting down to supper when the firing started.”</p>

<p>Chuck slung his blanket roll over his shoulder
and followed Slim up the trail.</p>

<p>They reached the patch of timber and found
that the small fire had burned itself out. The
bacon was cold and greasy and the coffee bitter.</p>

<p>“I’ll rustle more wood,” said Chuck and
Slim set about the simple preparations for the
joint meal.</p>

<p>In a short time the fire was glowing again
and the savory odor of frying bacon and boiling
coffee filled the night air.</p>

<p>“That sure smells good to me,” said Chuck,
squatting on his heels on the other side of the
fire. “I’ve been traveling a little too light.
Grub ran low and I cut out my noon meal figuring
that I’d be far enough down the trail
tonight to reach some ranch house and get a
real supper.”</p>

<p>“Guess you don’t know much about this
country,” said Slim as he deftly flipped the
bacon.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a ranch within miles. We’ve
got a good thirty miles of hoofing it down the
trail before we’ll be anywhere near a place we
can get horses.”</p>

<p>“You been through this country before?”
Slim thought that Chuck’s eyes were peering at
him intently from beneath the bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Never been over the crest of the Cajons
until this afternoon,” replied the cowboy from
the Flying Arrow, “but my Dad’s ridden
through here once or twice and he told me
something about the lay of the land before I
started out.”</p>

<p>“Kind of a lonesome country, then.”</p>

<p>“Lonesome and darned inhospitable, especially
the Creeping Shadows country over to
the northwest.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, I’ve heard that was a good place to
stay away from.”</p>

<p>Slim, who was serving as cook, used a forked
stick to pull the coffee pot out of the coals.
Doubling up a glove, he grasped the handle and
poured the steaming beverage into the battered
tin cups each cowboy carried in his duffel roll.</p>

<p>The night air near the summit of the Cajons
is crisp and cool even on a July night and the
warmth from the fire was cheering. They ate
in silence, draining the last drop from the coffee
pot and gleaning the final bit of crisp bacon
from the greasy pan.</p>

<p>“I’ll turn dish washer,” said Chuck, gathering
up the simple utensils they had needed for
the meal. He went down to the creek where
Slim could hear him splashing water on the
cups and the frying pan.</p>

<p>Slim piled more fuel on the fire and as the
flames leaped higher and the light brightened,
his eyes fell on an envelope which Chuck had
dropped.</p>

<p>Slim leaned over and picked up the letter. It
was face up and the address, “Chuck Meade,
Circle Four Ranch,” stared at him. But the
thing that really caught his attention was the
name of the sender of the letter in the upper
left hand corner. It was from Bill Needham,
secretary of the Mountain States Cattlemen’s
Association.</p>

<p>There was almost an irresistible temptation
to read the letter, but Slim conquered that impulse
and tossed the envelope over on Chuck’s
blanket roll.</p>

<p>It was strange that both should have letters
from the secretary of the cattle association and
that both should be riding down the Sky High
trail at almost the same hour.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch04' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Four</span><br /> <br />Trouble Looms</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Chuck returned with the handful of dishes
and laid them by the fire where the heat would
dry them thoroughly.</p>

<p>“You dropped a letter,” said Slim. “I tossed
it over on your blanket roll.”</p>

<p>Chuck straightened up quickly, almost too
quickly, thought Slim, and stepped around the
fire. The Circle Four cowboy picked up the
letter, glanced at it quickly but thoroughly,
and slipped it into an inner pocket.</p>

<p>“Thanks. It’s important, I wouldn’t want
to lose it.”</p>

<p>“There are lots of valuable things we don’t
like to lose,” said Slim. “Once in a while they
disappear and we can’t seem to do much about
it.” His eyes wandered over to the saddle
which he had pulled off Lightning only a little
more than two hours before.</p>

<p>“Meaning what?”</p>

<p>“Meaning my horse, for instance. If I’d
have thought for a minute that I’d have lost
Lightning when I went trailing down to help
you out, I’m not so sure I’d have gone.”</p>

<p>“You’re not putting a whole lot of value on
my life,” smiled Chuck.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s just that I’m placing a lot of
value on a good horse.”</p>

<p>“You must have thought a deal of that animal.
Now you take the cayuse that was shot
out from under me--just a plain range horse.
Plenty good for cow work, but nothing fancy,
and about as ornery as you can make them.
Course I hate to lose the horse, but I’m not
going to shed a whole lot of tears.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Slim felt his eyes filling
as he looked at the saddle. His voice choked.</p>

<p>“You can say that all right. You had just a
plain horse to lose--but I had Lightning.”</p>

<p>Chuck looked at his companion sharply and
saw that Slim was deeply affected.</p>

<p>“I never had anything but a cayuse,” he said.
“Maybe if I’d had a really fine horse I would
have some idea of how you feel.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you would. You see, Lightning
was almost human. I could talk to her and
she’d understand almost everything I said.”</p>

<p>“That’s a lot more than a good many humans
can do.”</p>

<p>“Lightning was smarter than a lot of humans.”
Slim stretched his long legs on the
blanket beside the fire, pillowed his head on the
saddle and looked up toward the new moon.</p>

<p>A desperate ache tugged at his heart. Lightning
was gone and there was only a great void
there. He had to talk, he had to tell Chuck
about the wonder of his horse. If he didn’t
he knew he would burst out in tears, a highly
undignified thing for a husky young cowhand
to do.</p>

<p>“Lightning was a sorrel with a white star
on her forehead and white feet. She was long-legged,
fast as the wind, and with plenty of endurance.
There wasn’t a horse anywhere
around that could make her go her limit, and
when it came time for the round-up, she could
do the work of any other three horses.”</p>

<p>“Sounds kinda like a wonder horse,” said
Chuck as he tossed another handful of wood on
the flames.</p>

<p>“She was a wonder horse in every sense of the
word,” went on Slim. “Lightning was a queer
mixture. Her mother just a plain cayuse on
the Flying Arrow. We never knew just
exactly what kind of a horse her father was, but
my Dad swears that it must have been Nige,
leader of the band of wild horses over on the
Sunfield spur of the Cajons. Nige’s never been
broken, and only a few people have ever been
able to get a rope around him. He’s a beauty--coal
black and all fire and temper.”</p>

<p>Chuck nodded.</p>

<p>Even over on the Circle Four they had heard
about Nige and his small band of wild horses
which roamed the eastern slope of the Cajons.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard there was Kentucky blood in
Nige,” said the Circle Four cowboy.</p>

<p>“That’s what my Dad always said,” went on
Slim. “Anyway one of our cayuses, just a plain
little sorrel with a splash of white on her face
and legs, was the mother of Lightning. She
was a colt in a thousand, you could see that at
a glance.”</p>

<p>Slim paused and looked up at the moon again
for comfort. The ache was still in his heart,
but talking to Chuck, telling him about
Lightning, was easing a little of the piercing
pain.</p>

<p>“I was just coming along to the age when
I was going to need a good horse,” went on
Slim, “and Dad picked out Lightning and
turned her over to me. We seemed to get
along first-rate right from the start, seemed
to understand just what the other wanted to do.
Why, I remember one time in spring round-up
when Lightning went into a prairie dog’s hole
and threw me. I busted one leg and sprained
the other so bad I couldn’t stand. There I was
sprawled flat on the range, five miles from the
chuck wagon and a thunderin’ big storm
whooping down out of the mountains.</p>

<p>“Lightning took one good look at me and
set out for the chuck wagon at a full gallop.
It wasn’t an hour later when she brought Dad
and the boys back with her. They got there
just before the rain and believe me, I was glad
to see them.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of horses like that,” nodded
Chuck, “but I never knew anyone that owned
one.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one Lightning. At first I
trained her so she wouldn’t let anyone else ride
her, but the other boys on the ranch didn’t like
it very well so I broke her of that habit. If I
hadn’t done that, she’d never have been ridden
away from here this afternoon. It used to be
she’d lash out with her feet whenever anyone
came near, but that was kinda dangerous on
the ranch.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose the fellows that were
gunning for me got her?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“All they had to do was to walk up and climb
on, she was that gentle. Believe me, if I ever
get her back, she’s going to be a one-man horse
from now on.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t much chance you’ll
ever get her back,” said Chuck, “if this country
is as sparsely settled as you say.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get her back somehow,” replied Slim
in a tone that brooked no good for the men who
had taken Lightning.</p>

<p>They were silent for a time, both thinking
of the long walk down the Sky High trail that
faced them with the coming of the dawn.</p>

<p>“Funny I didn’t see you ahead of me
when you went over the summit,” said Slim.</p>

<p>“I must have crossed a good hour ahead of
you. My horse was pretty badly winded and I
didn’t try to make much time for the first
half hour coming down this side. Fact of the
matter is, I stopped a little above here for water
and to let the cayuse graze.”</p>

<p>The fire was dying and there was no need to
put on fresh wood for they were ready to roll
into their blankets. Slim kicked his boots off,
pulled the blanket up around his shoulders, and
said good night to his new-found companion.</p>

<p>He was worn out by the long ride of the day,
the adventure in the boulder-strewn wash below
and the mental grief of having lost Lightning.
But sleep did not come at once.</p>

<p>Why had Chuck been ambushed? His
thoughts centered on the letter in his own
shirt and the one that Chuck had dropped.
Both were from Bill Needham. Could they be
on the same mysterious mission, could both be
answering a sudden call from the old cattleman?</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch05' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Five</span><br /> <br />The Unknown Rider</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim slept restlessly that night, his mind disturbed
by the grief and worry over the loss of
his horse. He was awake with the first rosy
tint in the sky above the Cajons.</p>

<p>Chuck was still sleeping soundly and Slim,
barefooted, walked quietly down to the creek
where he washed his face and hands. They had
used up the supply of wood gathered the night
before and he picked up an armful of dry sticks
before returning to the camp.</p>

<p>Chuck was awake and stretching lazily when
Slim dropped the wood beside the dead ashes.</p>

<p>“Going to be a great day for walking,” said
the Circle Four cowboy as he pulled on his
boots.</p>

<p>“Not for my feet after the beating I gave
them running around over the rocks in my
stocking feet,” said Slim.</p>

<p>While Chuck was at the creek washing, Slim
started the fire and checked over their supplies.
There was enough bacon for the morning meal
and four slices of bread that were so dry they
now resembled hardtack. Not much food for
a couple of hungry cowpunchers.</p>

<p>“We’re short of grub,” he informed Chuck.</p>

<p>“Just enough bacon for breakfast and a snack
of bread.”</p>

<p>“Might just as well start the day on a full
stomach. We’ll need it. How’s the coffee?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of coffee, but it’s going to take us at
least a day to reach the bottom of this trail.”</p>

<p>“Well, the coffee will help. We can drink
that and think we’ve had a meal.”</p>

<p>By the time the sun was up, they had finished
breakfast and were about the task of breaking
their simple camp.</p>

<p>“What about your saddle?” Chuck asked.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tote it with me as far as I can.
If it gets too heavy I’ll cache it along the way.
Dad gave it to me and I’m not going to take
any unnecessary chances of losing it.”</p>

<p>Slim made up his duffel roll and fastened it
to his saddle. Then he paused to look around
the camp and make sure nothing had been overlooked.
Chuck, rifle in hand, was waiting for
him.</p>

<p>Slim swung the heavy saddle on his back and
they started down the Sky High trail. It was
covered with a fair growth of grass, for in
recent years it was used by only an occasional
rider and the walking wouldn’t have been half
bad in low heeled shoes. But riding boots, with
their high heels, were never meant to pound
along over a none too smooth trail. Slim knew
that he would be in agony before the day was
over.</p>

<p>They reached the rock strewn wash where
Chuck had been ambushed and stopped while
the Circle Four cowboy picked up his saddle.
High above them a buzzard was circling. In
a few short hours Chuck’s cayuse would be
another skeleton along the trail, hinting at
an unsolved mystery.</p>

<p>Chuck stuck his rifle into the boot fastened
to his saddle and the cowboys resumed their
march down the trail. It was tough going over
the rocks, but they were soon out of the wash,
and the footing was a little better.</p>

<p>It was here that they picked up the trail of
the men who had bushwhacked Chuck. Slim
recognized Lightning’s hoofprints at once. A
little further along they found where two more
horses had been tethered for some time.</p>

<p>“They left their horses here while they went
up in the draw and used me for a target,” said
Chuck bitterly.</p>

<p>“Think you’d be able to recognize them if
you saw them again?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. The distance was too great
and the light was poor.”</p>

<p>“I’ll know one of them,” said Slim. “I put
my mark on him. Unless I miss my guess he’s
got a shattered right elbow. If I ever catch up
with him he’ll have something besides an elbow
busted all out of shape.”</p>

<p>The sun burned down over the Cajons and
the thin air soon warmed. Rivulets of perspiration
streamed down Chuck’s back and his
shirt was soon soaked. Slim, not quite so heavy,
felt the heat less.</p>

<p>They pounded along for better than an hour
when Chuck called a halt. “Let’s stop in the
shade of these scrub oaks. This saddle is digging
its way right into the middle of my back.”</p>

<p>Slim welcomed the suggestion and they
flopped down in the shade.</p>

<p>Chuck looked up speculatively at the clear
blue of the sky. There wasn’t a cloud in sight,
and the breeze had died down to a whisper.</p>

<p>“How many more miles to the bottom of the
trail?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. I’d say we’ve
covered about four miles since leaving camp.
It must be 23 or 24 more.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never make it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be at the foot of the trail tonight,”
said Slim.</p>

<p>“I’m supposed to be,” admitted Chuck, “but
I’ve serious doubts if my ‘dogs’ will hold out
for better than 20 miles.”</p>

<p>“We’d better keep pounding along. Another
hour and we’ll stop and make a pot of
coffee and find a creek where we can soak our
feet for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Good idea. Mine feel like they’re burning
up right now.”</p>

<p>Shouldering their saddles, they set off down
the trail. The grade was easing now. There
was more timber but the grass was still scarce.</p>

<p>“Not much grazing land here,” commented
Chuck.</p>

<p>“No. That’s up in the Creeping Shadows
country. I’ve never been there but I’ve heard
there’s some of the best grass in Wyoming in
that valley.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t have to be very good to be that,”
said Chuck. “We almost burned out this
summer. No rain for weeks.”</p>

<p>“There’s been little or no rain here, but the
Creeping Shadows always seem to get water.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a time and Slim
wondered why Chuck, too, was anxious to get
to the bottom of the trail that night. He
couldn’t help thinking about the letter which
had fallen from his companion’s pocket the
night before and there was still the unanswered
question on why Chuck had been set upon by
the two gunmen.</p>

<p>The sun was well toward its zenith when
they made their second stop beside a small
stream. There was a little grass and a few trees
in the valley, enough at least to provide them
with shade.</p>

<p>Slim pulled off his boots and socks and looked
at his feet. They were red and swollen.
Chuck’s looked to be in even worse condition.</p>

<p>The Circle Four cowboy crawled to the
water’s edge on his hands and knees and gratefully
thrust his feet into the cool water.</p>

<p>“Oh boy! What a relief. I didn’t know
water could feel so good. I’ve half a mind to
spend the rest of the day right here.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to spend it alone. I’m
going to push on as soon as my feet feel a little
better and we have some coffee.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the coffee will pep me up,” agreed
Chuck. “I’ll rustle up the wood in a little bit.”</p>

<p>The cool water reduced the swelling of their
feet and a few minutes later they donned their
socks and boots and picked up enough dry wood
for a fire. Slim filled the coffee pot and shortly
before noon they had two cups of the steaming
beverage apiece.</p>

<p>“Not much of a meal,” said Slim, “but it
puts a little more stiffening in my back.”</p>

<p>Chuck nodded, looking thoughtfully at his
saddle.</p>

<p>“Tell you what. I’m going to cache my
saddle. I don’t think we’ll make it to the bottom
of the trail tonight if we don’t. Once
rid of the saddles we’ll be able to walk a lot
faster and it will ease the strain on our feet.”</p>

<p>Slim looked down at his boots. The morning’s
walk over the uneven ground had done
them little good. The soles had been gouged
by sharp rocks and the heels were wearing
off at a crazy angle. By the end of the day he
would have to discard his expensive boots for he
doubted if even the most expert cobbler would
possess the skill to repair them.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” he agreed. “I hate to
leave my saddle, but I know I can’t carry it to
the bottom of the trail tonight.”</p>

<p>Chuck looked at Slim sharply, each perplexed,
perhaps a little alarmed, at the insistence
of the other upon reaching the trail’s end
by sundown.</p>

<p>Slim washed the coffee grounds out of the
pot and then placed the battered tin pot and
the remaining coffee in his blanket roll.</p>

<p>“There’s a little draw off to the left and
across the creek that ought to be a good place
to leave our saddles,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>They tossed the saddles across the creek and
then jumped after them. A thicket in the draw
which Chuck had pointed out proved ideal for
a cache. They returned to the other side of
the creek and slung their blanket rolls over their
shoulders.</p>

<p>Both cowboys had unfastened their rifle
scabbards from their saddles, and they carried
these in their right hands, the butts of the guns
protruding from the leather case.</p>

<p>With the burden of their saddles gone and
their feet rested, they set out down the trail
again. The blinding heat of midday was upon
them, but they dared not tarry longer beside
the creek.</p>

<p>Heads down and shoulders hunched, they
plodded along the trail. Hoofprints of three
horses were still plainly visible for the men who
had stolen Lightning had ridden down the trail
at a fast pace.</p>

<p>“Makes me boil inside every time I think of
my being set afoot,” snorted Chuck. “Maybe
I’ll take a little time off and hunt around for
the boys who did me dirt. With the souvenir
you left on that one chap’s arm, they shouldn’t
be so hard to find.”</p>

<p>They swung around a bend in the trail and
came upon the ashes of a recent campfire. Slim
placed his hand in the ashes. They were cold.</p>

<p>“The horses were staked out and hobbled
over here,” called out Chuck. “Too bad we
didn’t slip down the trail last night and take
them by surprise.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to think of those things now,”
grinned Slim as he picked up a handkerchief
which was covered with brown stains. “I don’t
imagine one of them passed a very comfortable
night.”</p>

<p>In midafternoon they paused beside another
mountain stream to rest and bathe their weary
feet.</p>

<p>“My ‘dogs’ look like they are going to explode,”
said Chuck as he wiggled his toes in the
cool water.</p>

<p>Slim, stretched on the bank beside him,
nodded. He was wondering if they would be
able to maintain their pace and make the bottom
of the trail that night. He didn’t want
to disappoint Bill Needham, for the old cattleman
had written that he was counting on him.</p>

<p>“My stomach and backbone are so close together
I’m afraid they’ll form a union and
strike on me,” grumbled Chuck, “unless I put
some food inside me quick.”</p>

<p>“There’s a little coffee left.”</p>

<p>“Then coffee it is,” said Chuck. He built a
fire and brewed a bitter pot of beverage.</p>

<p>“What did you drop in this? The heel of
one of your boots?” asked Slim as he sipped the
black stuff.</p>

<p>“Don’t complain. It’s hot and it’s filling,
which is the main thing.”</p>

<p>In spite of its poor taste, they downed the
coffee, drew on their boots, picked up the
rifles, and resumed the painful downward trip.</p>

<p>The sun was swinging well along toward the
horizon and the country was flattening out.
They had reached the foothills, but there was
still no sign of human habitation. Coming out
of a patch of timber, they looked down a long,
broad valley, the grass of which had been
burned out by the sun.</p>

<p>“I pity cattle trying to live off this stuff,”
said Slim.</p>

<p>“Better pity us. If we don’t find something
real to eat, we may have to take to grass.”</p>

<p>Chuck started down the trail again when
Slim’s call stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. There’s a horseman riding
into the lower end of the valley.”</p>

<p>Chuck halted and scanned the far end of the
valley.</p>

<p>“Can’t see a thing. Maybe you’re going
daffy.”</p>

<p>“I’m not daffy,” retorted Slim sharply.
“Just stand still a minute. The fellow’s coming
in from the right and he’s leading another
horse.”</p>

<p>Chuck shaded his eyes and peered intently
in the direction Slim had indicated.</p>

<p>“You’re right. What now?”</p>

<p>“Let’s drop back in the timber along the trail
and wait for him to come up where we can get
a good look.”</p>

<p>They found shelter in a tangle of brush that
had grown up around a fallen tree. Slim pulled
his rifle from the scabbard and threw open the
magazine. The weapon was ready for action.</p>

<p>“Not taking any chances?” Chuck asked.</p>

<p>“Nary a chance. I took one last night and
lost Lightning.”</p>

<p>The rider advanced rapidly but the sun
blazed in the eyes of the cowboys and they
found it difficult to see clearly.</p>

<p>The oncoming horseman was less than 400
yards away when Slim recognized the horse.</p>

<p>“He’s riding Lightning!” he cried. “Chuck
do you hear? That’s Lightning coming up the
trail!”</p>

<p>“Sure I hear and unless you pipe down that
rider will hear you and then Lightning may be
forced to go the other way in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Slim, who had stood up in his moment of
wild elation, crouched down behind the tree
trunk and cradled the butt of his rifle against
his cheek. The lines of his jaw snapped into
straight, tense lines and his finger crooked
around the trigger. A little further and the
unknown rider of Lightning would be out of
the angle of the Sun’s protecting rays.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch06' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Six</span><br /> <br />Lightning Returns</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim waited impatiently as the rider on Lightning
pressed on up the valley toward them. At
three hundred yards his finger pressed gently
on the trigger of his Winchester.</p>

<p>“Better wait a bit longer,” counseled Chuck.
“You might miss at this range.”</p>

<p>Slim snorted. “I’ve got him lined between
my sights right now. That guy is one horse
thief that isn’t going to get away.”</p>

<p>But Slim took Chuck’s advice and the tension
of his finger on the trigger lessened. The
target loomed larger, for the man riding Lightning
was heavy and of large stature.</p>

<p>Rider and horse drew nearer, the second
horse trailing Lightning by a few feet. It was
then that Slim noticed that the rifle of the rider
on Lightning was in the scabbard on the saddle
of the second horse. If he shot now, it would
be at a man armed at the most with only a six
shooter and one unable to answer him on even
terms. Slim knew that the horse thief didn’t
deserve such consideration, but in spite of his
rage at losing Lightning he couldn’t bring himself
to shoot a man in cold blood.</p>

<p>He dropped his rifle in disgust. “That fellow
hasn’t anything within reach but a six gun.
I can’t take a shot at him at this distance.”</p>

<p>“What you going to do?” queried Chuck.</p>

<p>“Wait until he comes up close and then step
out and hail him. If he goes for his six gun,
we’ll be on equal terms.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. Seems to me you
ought to be kind of handy with that six shooter
of yours. You’ve got long arms and long hands
and your gun is hung just right for fast action.”</p>

<p>“I can make it talk,” agreed Slim, his narrowed
eyes watching the approach of the rider,
now almost within hailing distance. If he continued
on the trail, he would pass within three
rods of the two cowboys.</p>

<p>Chuck looked down at his aching feet.</p>

<p>“Gosh, but it’s going to seem good to swing
back into a saddle. I’ve walked more today
than in years.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be riding again in about five minutes,
cowboy,” said Slim. “This fellow is coming
right into the center of a real unpleasant surprise
party.”</p>

<p>Slim shifted from his crouching position behind
the fallen tree and made sure that his gun
was free in the holster. There was a good
chance that he would need it in a hurry.</p>

<p>The rider on Lightning was within a hundred
yards of them when Slim stood up and
waited quietly beside the trail. The horseman
came on swiftly, unaware of the incensed cowboys
who were awaiting him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Slim shifted his plans. He knew
a bloodless but not altogether painless way to
capture the rider. Placing two fingers between
his lips, he sent a shrill, penetrating whistle
ringing down the valley.</p>

<p>Lightning stopped suddenly, poised like a
statue. Again the sharp whistle came from
Slim’s lips while Chuck watched in open-mouthed
astonishment.</p>

<p>Lightning whirled into action. The big
sorrel left the ground in a wild, twisting buck
that caught her rider unawares. Lightning almost
swapped ends and came down in a rocking,
jarring crash that sent the unknown rider
sprawling through the air to land with a thud
at one side of the trail.</p>

<p>Then the sorrel raced toward Slim, whinnying
in sheer delight at discovering her master
again.</p>

<p>Chuck ran down the trail to the side of the
fallen rider while Slim swung onto Lightning.
The sorrel fairly danced with pleasure over
the reunion and Slim reached down and stroked
the beautiful mane with gentle hands.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Lightning, old girl, it’s good to see
you again. Darn me! I thought last night it
was all over for us when I heard those bushwhackers
riding away. From now on no one
rides you but me. Understand?”</p>

<p>Lightning threw up her head in a quick,
angry manner that indicated anyone except
Slim would have a hard time mounting her.</p>

<p>From down the trail came a sharp cry from
Chuck.</p>

<p>“Hey, Slim. Come here and meet your horse
thief.”</p>

<p>The Flying Arrow cowboy swung Lightning
about and trotted down the trail. Chuck
was bending over the fallen man, who was now
showing some signs of a returning interest in
life.</p>

<p>“Think you can recognize him?” asked
Chuck as Slim slipped out of the saddle.</p>

<p>“Why it’s old Bill Needham!” exclaimed
Slim. “What under the sun could he have been
doing on Lightning?”</p>

<p>Old Bill, tall and powerful of frame, a typical
cattleman of the old school, managed to
raise his bruised body upon one elbow as he
squinted angrily at the two cowboys looking
down at him.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of pulling a stunt like
this on me?” he demanded. Then, recognizing
Slim as the mists cleared from his ancient eyes,
he added. “My gosh, Slim. I was just riding
up trail looking for you when that horse of
yours set off a stick of dynamite under my
saddle. How did it all happen?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we want to know,” said
Chuck. “There’s got to be a lot of explaining
about some things that took place last night
just this side of the divide.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, Chuck. I figured I’d find you
somewhere along the trail, but hadn’t counted
on you and Slim being together. Know each
other pretty well?”</p>

<p>“We ought to. We’ve done better than
twenty miles of hoofing it along this trail since
sunup. My feet are just about killing me.”
Chuck sat down and dragged off his boots,
massaging the bottoms of his burning feet with
his hands.</p>

<p>“Let’s hear the story, boys,” said Old Bill.
“Tell me what happened last night and I’ll tell
you how I happened to get hold of Lightning.”</p>

<p>Slim looked at Chuck.</p>

<p>“Everything happened this side of the divide
and you were the first over the summit. Start
the ball rolling.”</p>

<p>“There’s plenty to tell,” began Chuck. “I’d
been taking it fairly easy, figuring on plenty
of time to get to the foot of the trail. A little
more than a half hour of easy riding this side of
the crest of the trail a couple of hombres cut
loose on me with rifles.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they give you any warning?” asked
the old cattleman.</p>

<p>“Not a peep until the Winchesters started
blazing away. The first thing I knew my horse
caved in and pitched me off. I managed to get
my rifle and ducked into a side canyon, but it
was a trap--no way out. The other two had
plenty of shelter behind boulders in that dry
wash and they blazed away every time I moved.
It was getting along toward dark and looking
plenty tough for yours truly when someone
else voted himself a hand in the party and cut
loose on the bushwhackers from behind.”</p>

<p>Old Bill chuckled. “It isn’t hard to guess
who you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>“Well, that changed everything. Slim hit
one of them in the elbow and they decided
they’d had enough, but on the way out they
circled around and stole Slim’s horse.”</p>

<p>“So you started hoofing it down the trail.”</p>

<p>“You mean we started limping down the
trail,” said Slim. “These boots of mine were
never made for walking and I don’t know when
I’ve suffered such agony.”</p>

<p>“That goes for me, too,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>“How about you, Slim? Let’s hear your
side of the story,” Old Bill urged.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a whole lot more to tell. I had
made camp this side of the summit and was just
sitting down to supper when the firing started.
I could tell it was two against one so I got my
rifle and did a little scouting. When I got down
in the wash, I could see they had Chuck penned
up and were shooting to kill. I challenged
them and they let me have a little lead, so I
cut loose. They got away and stole Lightning
and I’ve been kind of miserable until you
showed up.”</p>

<p>“And say, you don’t know how near death
you were a few minutes ago,” Chuck said.
“Slim had you lined between his sights and was
all set to let you have it. Then he decided he
couldn’t kill a man in cold blood.”</p>

<p>“So he just whistled and had Lightning
dynamite me right out of the saddle,” chuckled
Old Bill. “Maybe the shooting wouldn’t have
been so bad after all.” He rubbed his bruised
body with exploring fingers. “Danged wonder
every bone in my body wasn’t broken.”</p>

<p>“You take your falls hard,” admitted Chuck.</p>

<p>“I want to know where you found Lightning,”
said Slim.</p>

<p>“The bushwhackers rode past my camp this
afternoon and I recognized Lightning in a
minute. I knew you would be riding Lightning
on a trip like this and I didn’t waste time
nor lead. They were leading Lightning and
when I started shooting, she broke away.
After what you did to them last night, those
fellows didn’t have much stomach for another
fight and they took out full gallop for the
Creeping Shadows valley. It wasn’t much
trouble to round up Lightning for she seemed
to remember me a bit from my visits to the
Flying Arrow. But boy, when you whistled
she forgot all about me. I never saw a horse
go up so quick or come down so hard. Don’t
ever do that again to me.”</p>

<p>“I never will,” promised Slim, “but it’s a
good trick to keep in the bag. If I’d been real
smart last night I think I could have stopped
Lightning by whistling to her, but I wasn’t
thinking very straight. When I heard the
bushwhackers galloping off on her I just saw
red in about five different shades.”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you a bit, son,” said Old Bill.
“Now let’s get down to the business of making
camp and getting some grub. No use of our
going to the bottom of the trail tonight. We’ll
make camp here and I’ll tell you what I’ve got
up my sleeve.”</p>

<p>Slim looked toward Chuck and jerked a
thumb.</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s in this thing as deep as you are. Just
have a little patience. We’ll eat, then talk. A
man can’t think well on an empty stomach.”</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch07' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Seven</span><br /> <br />Explanations</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>They agreed with Old Bill’s simple philosophy
and all three set about making camp. Slim
took care of Lightning and Old Bill’s horse
while Chuck went about rustling an armful of
wood.</p>

<p>Old Bill opened his blanket roll and a goodly
supply of provisions was revealed, something
more than the bitter coffee on which they had
tried to satisfy their hunger that day.</p>

<p>A crackling fire was soon going, the bacon
broiling and the potatoes frying. There was
plenty of bread and a pot of delicious coffee.
Slim and Chuck ate to their fill, and Old Bill
watched them with twinkling eyes. These
were youngsters after his own heart, clean,
manly young chaps--able to ride with the best
in the west, afraid of nothing, including mountain
wildcats. He knew that he could count
on them for the work that was ahead.</p>

<p>When they had finished the meal, Slim and
Chuck took the few utensils to the nearby
stream where they washed them in the cool
water. By the time they were back at camp,
Old Bill had the blankets spread out, more fuel
on the fire, and his pipe going. He was ready
to talk, ready to tell them why he had summoned
them to meet him so mysteriously on the
Sky High trail.</p>

<p>The cowboy from the Flying Arrow and
the one from the Circle Four eased their weary
bodies down on the blankets and waited for
Old Bill to speak. The cattleman shifted his
pipe.</p>

<p>“I’ll start in from the first,” he said. “It goes
quite a ways back into Wyoming cattle history,
but it’s best that you know fully what you’re
going into.”</p>

<p>He jerked a thumb in the general direction
of the Creeping Shadows country.</p>

<p>“That’s the best cattle country in this part
of the west--plenty of rich grass and lots of
water that’s good all of the year round. The
valley is set down between the Cajons and the
Three Soldiers and it’s warmer than most parts
of Wyoming in the winter. But it’s tough
country to get into--too expensive for a railroad
for the amount of business, so the world
has sort of forgotten the valley except when the
trail herds come out in the fall on the way to
the loading yards at Mopstick. The valley is
just as tough, maybe a little tougher, than it
was thirty years ago when Adam Marks went
in and started the Box B. Adam had a fight on
his hands then and he’s got one now.”</p>

<p>“So we’re headed for the Box B?” said Slim
softly. He had heard his father speak of Adam
Marks and the Box B, of the fine grass and
water on the range and of the choice cattle the
Box B sent to market each fall.</p>

<p>“You two are headed for the Box B,” corrected
Old Bill.</p>

<p>“You voting yourself out?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“I never voted myself in. Now don’t jump
at conclusions. Adam went into the Creeping
Shadows country when it was a nest of outlaws.
He was honest and clean and he bought
his land. He took with him a hard-riding,
hard-fighting bunch of punchers that were
handy with fist or gun. He cleaned up the
valley except the town of Dirty Water and
that was too tough even for Adam to fumigate.</p>

<p>“To shorten up the story, Adam prospered.
He kept buying more land and increasing his
range stock. He was figured a millionaire a
couple of times over but the bottom went out
of the beef market and then rustling started
again and it’s been growing worse the last few
months. Adam has lost hundreds of fine cattle
and he hasn’t been able to put his finger on
the gang responsible.”</p>

<p>“Which means you’ve picked Slim and me to
go in and do a little Sherlock Holmes work for
you,” interjected Chuck. “How about your
regular cattle detectives?”</p>

<p>“I was just getting to that,” said Old Bill a
little wearily. “Adam sent word to me that
he was in trouble and I sent a good man into the
valley. He never came back. Then Adam sent
another call to the association for help and I
sent another good riding detective, but after a
week in the valley with Adam’s boys, he did
a disappearing act.”</p>

<p>“Someone scare him?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“They were the type that didn’t scare. I
think someone shot them just like they attempted
to get you yesterday.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have to be a lot better shots than
that if they figure on getting me,” snorted
Chuck. “They missed me the first time. Say,
I could knock an apple off a man’s head at that
range ten times out of ten and never touch a
hair on his head.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason I sent word for you to
meet me here,” said Old Bill. “Adam Marks is
up against a tough proposition. I’ve lost two
of my regular detectives on the job. It isn’t
that I’m afraid to send them in, but I know it’s
pure murder for them if I do. They’re all
known. What I need is two fellows who look
and act like a couple of gay young buckaroos
that don’t have a responsibility in the world
and don’t care much where they hang their
hats just so there’s a peg handy.</p>

<p>“I picked you boys for several reasons. Slim
has done a couple of little jobs for me over near
Sunfield and I know he’s got a good head and a
cool one. In addition, he’s a dead shot with a
six gun. Chuck’s a fine rider and the best man
with a rifle I’ve seen in many a year. Slim, your
temper is likely to flash a bit too hot at times,
but I figure that Chuck being a little slower to
fly off the handle will kind of keep a check on
you. In other words, you’re my idea of the
right kind of a team to send into the Creeping
Shadows country and ferret out these rustlers.”</p>

<p>Slim looked across the fire at Chuck, carefully
appraising the cowboy from the Circle
Four. He had liked Chuck from the very first.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t much like being shot at without
warning,” said Chuck, “so you can count me
in to see this thing through. I’ve a pretty
strong hunch we’ll find the fellows that gave
me the lead greeting tangled up with this gang
of rustlers.”</p>

<p>“And I’m still mad about Lightning being
stolen,” added Slim. “Looks like both of us
have a debt to repay those birds in the Creeping
Shadows. Count me in.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” added Chuck heartily.</p>

<p>Old Bill smiled broadly. He had felt sure
that these youngsters would come through.
He reached over to the nearby woodpile and
tossed a couple of large sticks on the flames.
The fire brightened, chasing the shadows away
from the men stretched on the blankets.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a mistake and think this is going
to be an easy job,” cautioned Old Bill.
“You’ll have to do plenty of hard work and a
lot of tough riding. You’re going into this
thing alone. Not even Adam Marks will know
who you are.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“He knew that the other men I sent in were
detectives. They never came back.”</p>

<p>“You’re not hinting that Marks is rustling
his own cattle?”</p>

<p>“I’m not hinting at a thing,” replied Old
Bill sharply. “I’m simply telling you the facts.
No one must know you have any possible association
with me. That’s why I asked both of
you to meet me on this lonely trail.”</p>

<p>“I was ‘met’ all right,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>“That worries me,” said Old Bill. “It makes
it a lot harder for you boys. The gang operating
in the Creeping Shadows must figure I’ll be
sending in more men and have every incoming
trail picketed.”</p>

<p>“But they never gave me a chance.”</p>

<p>“This gang won’t.”</p>

<p>“When do you want us to start for the valley?”
asked Slim.</p>

<p>Old Bill was silent for a time.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get a horse for Chuck and
new boots for both of you,” he said at last.
“Then I’d better get a complete change of
clothes for Chuck. That’s a pretty loud shirt
he’s wearing and it might be a give-away when
he reaches the valley, especially if those hombres
got a good look at it. I think you better
have your hair cropped close, too, Chuck. That
would change your appearance a lot.”</p>

<p>“You mean it would ruin my manly
beauty,” howled Chuck. “Who’s going to do
all this barbering, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride back across the Cajons by another
trail I know they won’t be watching, get another
horse for you, buy boots for both of you,
clothes for Chuck and bring back a pair of
hair clippers.”</p>

<p>“While you’re worrying so much about me,
what about Slim and Lightning?” Chuck
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“They never saw Slim in the daylight and I’ll
get a little dye while I’m on the other side and
we’ll make Lightning a solid sorrel. That
ought to fool them.”</p>

<p>“Better buy me a saddle,” suggested Slim.
“My own outfit looks too good for a wandering
cowboy.”</p>

<p>“One thing,” grinned Chuck, “we’ll have a
couple of days to rest here and let the swelling
in our feet go down.”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” agreed Slim. “My main
worry was getting Lightning back.”</p>

<p>They talked a few more minutes, then rolled
into their blankets as the fire died down. The
moon, coming up over the Cajons, looked down
on the sleeping camp, and swung on toward the
west.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch08' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Eight</span><br /> <br />The Vanishing Camp</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>They were out of their blankets at sunup, for
Old Bill had a long ride ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Better let one of us make the trip,” suggested
Slim.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” replied the cattleman. “You boys
hole up here. I don’t want you chasing around
much until you’re all ready to ride into the
Creeping Shadows and look for a job on the
Box B.”</p>

<p>They all lent a hand in getting breakfast.
Then Old Bill got his horse, swung into the
saddle, and went off down the trail.</p>

<p>Chuck washed their few dishes while Slim
got the camp in shape. When they had completed
their tasks, they sat down and contemplated
the bright freshness of the morning.</p>

<p>Chuck wiggled his toes gratefully as he
looked at his badly worn boots.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be great to have at least a
day to loaf and let my feet catch up with the
rest of me. Hope Old Bill gets a good fit in
boots.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you give him your size?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“Gosh, no. I forgot all about that.”
Chuck’s face registered real dismay.</p>

<p>“If he gets the largest boots in the store they
won’t be any too small,” chuckled Slim as he
surveyed Chuck’s broad feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll have no insults cast at my underpinning,”
roared the cowboy from the Circle Four,
hurling a near-by stick at Slim.</p>

<p>Slim ducked with a grin as the stick whistled
by.</p>

<p>“If you feel like throwing things, I’ll be on
my way.”</p>

<p>“How come?”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that I’ve got a horse.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not pulling out?” Chuck was
genuinely startled, afraid that Slim had believed
him serious when he had tossed the stick.</p>

<p>“I’m pulling out in about five minutes, but
I’m only going to ride back up the trail and
bring down the saddles we cached yesterday.
It will save time when Old Bill returns.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. After the reception we got
night before last I’m anxious to get into the
Creeping Shadows country and see what it’s all
about.”</p>

<p>Slim found Lightning nearby, grazing on a
patch of grass that somehow had escaped the
searing rays of the July sun. He vaulted onto
the beautiful back and ran his fingers through
the splendid mane. A queer sob choked his
throat as he thought how near he had been to
losing forever the horse which had become his
companion.</p>

<p>“Let’s go, Lightning.” The voice was low
but Lightning pricked up her ears and trotted
briskly toward the camp.</p>

<p>Chuck stood up as they approached, openly
admiring the beautiful sorrel.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Slim. If you ever lose your
horse again, come on over to the Circle Four.
You’ll probably find that I’ve stolen her. Why,
she’s the finest horse in the cow country.”</p>

<p>“Or any other country,” added Slim
proudly. “We’ll amble. See you this afternoon
for I’m going to take my time.”</p>

<p>“How about grub this noon?”</p>

<p>“I had enough at breakfast to last until
supper.”</p>

<p>With a cheery wave to his companion, Slim
gave Lightning her head and to the music of
swiftly drumming hoofs, disappeared up the
valley, heading back along the Sky High trail.</p>

<p>Slim soon brought Lightning down to an
easy lope, a tireless pace that was capable of eating
up the miles when on a day-long trail. But
there was no need for even that much speed,
and a few minutes later he pulled her down to
a walk.</p>

<p>It was a glorious July morning such as only
the Cajon country knows, with the air sweet
and clean. As the trail mounted toward the
crest, Slim turned to look toward the Creeping
Shadows country. The air was clearer than on
his first glimpse from the summit, and he could
see the broad valley lying below the Three
Soldiers.</p>

<p>Even at that distance it was clear that there
were many open meadows and from what Slim
knew of the country, they would be rich with
the grass needed to make fat cattle. It seemed
incredible that such a beautiful country was a
land of lawlessness and violence where the life
and wealth of a man like Adam Marks was in
daily danger.</p>

<p>From a distance came the faint drumming of
hoofs. Slim had no desire to be seen on the trail
and he sent Lightning leaping behind the protection
of a dense thicket. His rifle was in
camp, but his revolver was in the holster at his
side. With deft hands, he made sure that the
gun was ready for instant use. Then he slipped
off Lightning’s back and stepped up to the sorrel’s
head, placing one hand gently over the
nostrils. He couldn’t afford to have Lightning
whinny as the other riders passed by.</p>

<p>A few seconds later two horsemen appeared
down the trail. They had evidently been riding
hard, but the grade steepened just below
Slim and they brought their tired horses down
to walk. The riders were dressed in conventional
cowboy garb, Stetsons, blue shirts with
a kerchief caught carelessly around the neck
and well worn leather chaps. Each man carried
sidearms and a rifle in the boot on his saddle.
They were burned to a deep brown by days in
the sun, but there was also a hardness about
their features that was not reassuring to Slim.
They looked like a couple of tough customers.</p>

<p>Slim could hear them talking and he listened
intently to catch their words.</p>

<p>“How much further to the summit?” asked
the shorter of the two.</p>

<p>“Must be all of ten miles,” was the reply.
“I’m not sure; never been to the top before.”</p>

<p>“Seems kinda foolish to have to watch this
trail, but the chief is sure plenty mad about
the way Newt and Maxie handled this deal.
Means there’s a couple of cowboys on the prod
somewhere in the valley.”</p>

<p>“And probably plenty mad, what with one
of them getting his horse shot out from under
him and both of them having to hoof it down
from the summit.”</p>

<p>“Kinda funny we didn’t run across them,”
said the squat, heavy-set puncher.</p>

<p>“It’s all right with me that we didn’t,”
growled his companion. “Look at the elbow
Maxie’s got. He won’t be able to use it for a
couple of months. If that slug had been a
little deeper, Maxie could have kissed his arm
goodbye.”</p>

<p>“All the same, it seems darned foolish ordering
us up here to see that no one comes down
the trail. The chief’s either getting ready to
pull a big raid or he’s getting cold feet and is
going to leave the valley.”</p>

<p>The voices were fainter as the riders went up
the trail, but Slim listened eagerly to get the
reply of the taller puncher.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about the chief getting cold
feet. He’s got all of the nerve in the world. In
a little while, he’s going to be the cattle king
of the Creeping Shadows.”</p>

<p>Slim smiled grimly. The “chief” would be
cattle king only after he had disposed of Adam
Marks and if there was anything Slim and
Chuck could do to prevent it, that would never
be accomplished.</p>

<p>A few rods further Slim came to the stream
where they had rested and cached their saddles.
He crossed the stream and went into the gulch
where the saddles had been hidden. They were
intact and after watering Lightning he swung
his own onto Lightning’s back and cinched it
firmly. Then he fastened Chuck’s broad saddle
on behind his own.</p>

<p>The sun was well toward its zenith when he
started leisurely down the trail. Riding astride
the easy-gaited Lightning, the trip was in
marked contrast to the painful journey of the
day before when each step had been agony to
their tired and swollen feet. The memory
made his feet hurt and Slim shoved thoughts of
the trail into the back of his mind.</p>

<p>Slim’s trip back down the trail was made at
a most leisurely pace. There was no need to
hurry, and aside from keeping an alert lookout
for some chance rider coming up from the
valley, he enjoyed every bit of it. It was mid
afternoon when he swung off the trail and
turned to the left to their own camp. When
he reached the stream bank where they had
passed the night every trace of their camp had
vanished!</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch09' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Nine</span><br /> <br />Secret Commissions</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim looked at the scene in amazement.
Blankets, cooking utensils and even Chuck had
disappeared. The ashes of their fire had been
scattered and made to look as though days had
elapsed since the camp had been there.</p>

<p>The cowboy from the Flying Arrow looked
around cautiously, afraid that he had stepped
into a trap laid by the rustlers from the valley
of the Creeping Shadows.</p>

<p>While he raked his mind for some solution
to the disappearance of the camp, a low whistle
sounded from across the stream. Slim whirled
quickly, his right hand poised for a fast grab
at his gun if necessary.</p>

<p>Above a fringe of underbrush on the further
bank, Chuck was peering at him.</p>

<p>“What happened to the camp?” demanded
Slim.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you meet any riders along the trail?”</p>

<p>“Two.”</p>

<p>“How do you think they got up that far if
they didn’t come by here? I heard them coming
and believe me, I dusted around and made
our camp do a vanishing act. You want to
remember we’re not far off the trail and this
looks like a handy watering place on a hot day.
I wasn’t taking any chances.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can come out of hiding now.
Those fellows are at the summit by this time
and from what I gathered as they went by me,
they’ll be there quite a while.”</p>

<p>Chuck emerged from the undergrowth,
carrying his rifle in one hand. He jumped from
one rock to another, and finally arrived on
Slim’s side of the stream.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have to lug all of the duffel and
grub over here,” said the Flying Arrow cowboy.</p>

<p>“Not on your life. There’s a fine bite of
grass on the other side and a little hollow to
hide our fire. No more camps near the trail
for me.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting worse than an old hen,”
protested Slim.</p>

<p>“I am, huh! Well listen to me. The boys
that rode up the trail swung down to the stream
here to water their horses. It was a darned
good thing I was on the job and had sense
enough to get our stuff out of sight. Why, I
sat over there with my rifle trained on them
just itching for a chance to bang away. But I’d
done my job too well. I hadn’t left a thing for
them to steal.”</p>

<p>“Hear much they said?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“Everything, but they only talked about
the heat and the long ride up to the summit.”</p>

<p>“I heard enough when they went by me to
warn us that we’d better get over to the Box B
as soon as possible. That gang is drawing a
tight net around every entrance or exit from
this country. Something big is going to happen
and unless there’s some outside help on the
job, Adam Marks may be wiped out.”</p>

<p>“Got any idea who’s running the rustlers?”</p>

<p>“They mentioned ‘the chief’ once or twice,
but never repeated his name. I’ve a hunch he’ll
be a hard one to run down. A man operating
a gang as efficient as this one seems to be won’t
leave many loose strings around.”</p>

<p>Slim gave Lightning her head and the sorrel
picked her way across the bubbling stream. He
unfastened Chuck’s saddle and let it drop to the
ground. Then he went back across the creek
and Chuck managed to mount behind Slim,
riding back across the stream in this manner.</p>

<p>Chuck had found an ideal camp spot. The
grass was rich, there was plenty of wood, and
the swale was deep enough to hide their fire.</p>

<p>Slim turned Lightning out to graze and then
both turned a hand to the task of getting their
simple camp in shape for the night. That done,
they went down to the creek bank, and loafed
in the rays of the afternoon sun. Chuck
watched the swift-moving waters.</p>

<p>“There’s a pool below with plenty of trout.
I watched them this morning, but didn’t have
a thing to catch them with. Gosh, a mess of
mountain trout would taste good.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure there’re trout in the pool?”</p>

<p>“Saw them with my own eyes.”</p>

<p>Slim hastened back to their camp and dug
deep into his saddlebags. He pulled out a small
oilskin packet and from that produced a length
of sturdy line and two artificial flies, a little
the worse for wear, but still usable. Slim
fastened the best one to the line and returned to
the stream.</p>

<p>“Try your luck with this,” he said, dropping
the fly and line at Chuck’s feet.</p>

<p>“You can start the fire now,” grinned Chuck
as he picked up the line and started for the pool.
“I’ll have a couple of one pounders in five
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Say, who’s going to clean the fish?” asked
Slim.</p>

<p>“If I catch them, you ought to be willing to
do the cleaning,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>“But it’s my tackle you’re using,” Slim reminded
him.</p>

<p>“You would have to suggest that,” retorted
Chuck. “That being the case, we’ll split the
work. I’ll catch the fish, you build the fire,
and we’ll both clean them.”</p>

<p>“If any,” chuckled Slim.</p>

<p>Chuck strode off downstream and Slim
gathered up an armful of wood for the fire.
Then he walked down to the pool. Chuck had
used his knife to cut a sapling for use as a pole
and he was casting energetically with the fly.</p>

<p>“How many?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“Not a one so far, but just wait a minute.”</p>

<p>Five more casts failed to produce a strike
and Chuck’s confidence started to crumble.</p>

<p>“Let me have a try.” Slim took the homemade
pole and moved downstream to a point
where the rays of the sun streamed warmly on
the water. The fly flicked the surface of the
water, again and then again. On the fourth
cast there was a flash of silver and a trout was
hooked hard.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him, you’ve got him!” shouted
Chuck, dancing along the bank oblivious of his
tender feet. “Don’t lose him.”</p>

<p>“I won’t unless your shouting scares him
away.”</p>

<p>The trout was a beauty, at least a pound and
a half if Slim was any judge, and he played the
fish carefully, finally drawing it close enough
to the bank so Chuck could reach down and get
it in his hands.</p>

<p>“What a beauty,” said the Circle Four cowboy
as he held the trout in his hands. “Some
people have all the luck.”</p>

<p>“You mean some people have all the skill,”
grinned Slim, casting the fly back into the now
quiet waters of the pool. He was patient and
a fair judge of trout water, the result being that
a few minutes later he got another strike, but
this one finally eluded him. Slim got a third
strike and this time landed his fish, which was
larger than the first.</p>

<p>Returning to camp, they set about the task
of cleaning the fish. Old Bill had left them
plenty of food, and at sundown they stretched
out beside the fire to enjoy their evening meal.
The trout was delicious and there was plenty
for both.</p>

<p>Supper over, they lolled on their blankets,
watching the last light of day fade and the
evening star brighten.</p>

<p>The night was uneventful and in the morning
Slim again fished the trout pool. His luck
held with him and he managed to land five trout
in a little more than an hour.</p>

<p>“We’ll have enough for supper, even with
Old Bill here,” said Chuck as he surveyed the
catch of silver beauties.</p>

<p>During the day they kept a close watch on
the trail but it was not until late afternoon that
Old Bill appeared riding up out of the valley.
He was leading a horse and his own saddlebags
were bulging with articles he had purchased
on the other side of the Cajons.</p>

<p>Chuck looked at the horse with a critical eye.</p>

<p>“That’s a skinny nag you brought me,” he
said, after greetings had been exchanged.</p>

<p>“Maybe it will take a little of the extra
weight off you; kinda saw you down in the
middle,” chuckled Old Bill as he swung out of
his saddle.</p>

<p>They gave the cattleman a hand in unloading
the saddlebags and unfastening the boots
which he had tied to his saddle.</p>

<p>Chuck hobbled the cayuse Old Bill had
brought for him and then joined the others in
camp.</p>

<p>“Have to move across the creek?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>“A little company rode up the trail yesterday
and I figured it was best not to be seen,”
said Chuck. “Slim saw them higher up the
trail, but he gave them the slip, too. They
were going up to the crest of the Cajons to
make sure that no one else wanders into this
country by that route.”</p>

<p>Old Bill nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“They’re plugging up every trail into the
Creeping Shadows country. Lucky thing I
know an old one that’s been forgotten by
everyone except myself and Adam Marks.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the rustlers are using that one to get
the cattle out,” suggested Chuck.</p>

<p>“I’d know if they were sending cattle out
that way,” replied Old Bill.</p>

<p>Chuck unwrapped a package the cattleman
tossed toward him. It contained a change of
trousers and a shirt of plain blue material.</p>

<p>“Why this isn’t even new,” protested Chuck.</p>

<p>“Of course not. Think I want you going
into the valley with a brand new outfit when
you’re supposed to be a cowboy who’s nearly
broke and willing to work for just about any
kind of a wage? I got the shirt and pants from
an old clothes dealer. They’re clean. Put
them on.”</p>

<p>Chuck mournfully took off his brightly
checked shirt and in its place pulled the blue
one over his head. The trousers were too large
even for Chuck, but they would do.</p>

<p>“How about the boots?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“I got in an awful jam,” confessed Old Bill.
“I knew your size but I forgot to ask Chuck
what size he wore so I just got the biggest in the
store.”</p>

<p>Slim found that the boots Old Bill had
brought fitted comfortably. Like the shirt and
trousers for Chuck, the boots were from a
second hand store, and as a result were well
broken in.</p>

<p>Old Bill’s guess had been good, and Chuck
failed to grumble when he eased his feet into the
boots.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll get at the important business,”
said the cattleman, producing a pair of hair
clippers.</p>

<p>“Is that necessary?” asked Chuck hopefully.</p>

<p>“We’re going to do this thing right. When
I get through with you, neither one of the hombres
who jumped you up near the summit will
ever recognize you.”</p>

<p>Chuck sat down on the grass and Old Bill
started snipping away. He wasn’t expert as a
barber, but he managed a fair job which Slim,
grinning at Chuck’s protests, watched.</p>

<p>The new haircut certainly made a difference
in Chuck, and Slim felt that in Old Bill
they had a wise counsellor.</p>

<p>After the hair-cutting operation was completed,
Old Bill turned to Slim.</p>

<p>“Bring Lightning up and we’ll get at the
dyeing of her white spots.” He opened up a
can of dye and mixed it in one of the tin cups,
working until he had the mixture just the shade
of Lightning’s sleek hair. Then, with a soft
cloth, he rubbed on the dye while the big sorrel
stood patiently, wondering just what it was
all about.</p>

<p>First the star on the forehead was changed
from white to sorrel, then the white on the legs
was dyed. When the task was finished, Slim
stepped a few paces from his mount. The dye
had blended beautifully with the natural shade
and it would have taken an expert to have detected
that dye had been used.</p>

<p>Slim put the new saddle Old Bill had
brought on Lightning, drew up the cinches,
and mounted. He rocked back and forth in
the stirrups, then dismounted and adjusted
them. Once more he mounted, this time satisfied,
and a smile broke over his lips.</p>

<p>“I’m all set for whatever we run into in the
Creeping Shadows country,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ll run into plenty of trouble,” promised
Old Bill. “Let’s eat. I’m half starved.”</p>

<p>Slim fried the trout and half an hour later,
with the sun dropping down behind the Three
Soldiers and the twilight coming up out of the
Creeping Shadows, they sat down around the
campfire. There was little conversation during
the meal, for to riders of the range food is
too important to mix with idle talk.</p>

<p>The supper over, Slim and Chuck washed up
the dishes while Old Bill stretched out on his
blanket and puffed contentedly at his pipe.</p>

<p>“Looks like we’re all set to start in the morning,”
said Chuck, returning to the campfire.</p>

<p>“The earlier the better,” replied Old Bill.
“It’s a good day’s jog down to Dirty Water.
That’s the one town in the Creeping Shadows
and you’ll want to hit there first and make a
few inquiries about jobs. Course the only
ranch I want you to work on is the Box B, so if
some misguided soul offers you another job,
you’ll have to do some quick thinking and get
out of it.”</p>

<p>“What will we say if someone in Dirty
Water gets curious and wants to know how we
rode in?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em the truth. Say you came down
the Sky High trail, but don’t say anything
more. No one will recognize you, what with
Chuck having a new haircut and a shirt that
doesn’t talk out loud.”</p>

<p>“What about the fellows guarding the
trail?” Chuck wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Whoever asks will probably know about
the guards and if you tell him you came down
Sky High, it will cause a little trouble for the
guards, which should be all right with you.”</p>

<p>“And we’re not to tell Adam Marks we’re
working for you?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“Not unless it is absolutely necessary.
Don’t talk any more than you have to. The
less you say, the better off you’ll be. Just keep
your ears and eyes open.”</p>

<p>Old Bill sat up and drew a leather folder
from an inner pocket. From this he extracted
two slips of heavy paper and two small silver
emblems.</p>

<p>“When I figured I’d call on you boys to help
me solve the mystery of the Creeping Shadows,
I went down to see the governor at Laramie.
He’s made you boys special agents directly
under him with authority to act in any part of
the state. These slips of paper are your commissions
from the governor and the little silver
shields are your badges. See that no one gets
hold of them or your life won’t be worth the
paper those commissions are written on.”</p>

<p>Slim took the paper and badge Old Bill
handed him, and read the commission which
made him a special agent of the state. Then he
folded it carefully and placed it in the bottom
of his right boot. Chuck did likewise and both
cowboys fastened the badges on the inside of
their Stetsons where the sweat band would hide
them from any observer.</p>

<p>“Those badges mean that the entire law enforcement
machinery of this state is behind you
in your quest for the rustlers,” pointed out Old
Bill. “When you learn the truth of what’s
going on in the valley, send for me. If there
isn’t time for that, use the power of the law
which those badges give you.”</p>

<p>Slim’s fingers slid inside his hat and he
fingered the tiny silver shield. He hoped that
he wouldn’t have to call on the power which
the badge represented.</p>

<p>Shortly after that they rolled into their
blankets, for a long ride was ahead of the young
cow punchers with the dawn of the next day.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch10' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Ten</span><br /> <br />Dirty Water</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Breakfast next morning was finished in
quick time and they set about breaking camp.
Slim cached his own saddle and under it Chuck
placed his extra clothing.</p>

<p>They brought their mounts up to the camp
and saddled them. Slim patted Lightning affectionately,
talking to her as he drew the
cinches tight.</p>

<p>“We’re going on another adventure, old
girl,” he said softly, “and I’m counting on you
to help me win. If we get in any tight spots,
it may be up to you and your speed. How
about it?”</p>

<p>If Lightning didn’t understand the exact
words, she sensed that her master was praising
her, and she tossed her head proudly.</p>

<p>Slim looked carefully at the places where
Old Bill had applied the dye. There was no
trace of the pigment and to all intents and purposes
Lightning was simply another sorrel.
True, she was a little larger and longer of leg
than the average range horse, but not uncommon
enough to attract unusual attention.</p>

<p>Chuck’s new mount was just a plain calico
cayuse, a good sturdy horse with plenty of endurance
and a good trail gait.</p>

<p>“Fixed on cash?” asked Old Bill.</p>

<p>“We’re supposed to be broke,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>“Sure enough, but I thought you might need
a bit for emergencies.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got enough for that,” said the Circle
Four cowboy and Slim added that he had sufficient
cash to carry him along.</p>

<p>The sun was just topping the Cajons when
they swung into their saddles and splashed
across the noisy mountain stream. They
reached Sky High trail and took the turn to
the left, heading down for the valley. For an
hour they rode steadily with Old Bill in the
lead. Then they came to a fork in the trail and
the cattleman halted.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we part. I’m going left and
out beyond the Cajons by the old trail. You
boys take the way to the right. It’s a good
day’s ride to Dirty Water and unless I miss my
guess, that’s where you’ll find the rustlers. I’m
counting on you boys to turn them up for us.
When you need me you can send a telegram
from the railroad station at Mopstick. That’s
outside the valley, but it’s the nearest telegraph
office. Good luck.”</p>

<p>Old Bill gave each of them a firm, warm
handclasp that conveyed more than words,
swung his horse around sharply, and moved
briskly down the left fork of the trail.</p>

<p>Chuck and Slim watched him until a clump
of aspen hid him from view. Then they spoke
to their own horses and turned onto the trail
that led to the Creeping Shadows.</p>

<p>The cowboy detectives rode at a steady pace
that ate up miles on the long down trail into
the valley.</p>

<p>Through midday the sun burned down on
them unmercifully, but they paused at noon
only long enough to water their horses.</p>

<p>Slim rode in the lead, little spurts of dust
leaping up around Lightning’s hoofs. The
Flying Arrow rider kept his head bowed to
shield his face from the burning rays of the sun.</p>

<p>They left the foothills and entered the
Creeping Shadows country, a broad, rolling
land that was sheltered between the Cajons on
the east and south and the mighty Three Soldiers
range which reared its peaks in the west.</p>

<p>Streams tumbling down the sides of the
ranges converged in the valley and assured the
cattlemen there of plenty of water. There
was ample timber and the grass was lush and
long, though now burned badly by the long
drought. It was a cattleman’s paradise and
Slim, as he appraised the worth of the valley,
could realize why rustlers would make a bold
bid to steal the possessions of Adam Marks and
take the valley for their own.</p>

<p>Lightning seemed to sense her rider’s
thoughts for she paused at the crest of a knoll
as though to give Slim a better chance to view
the country which unfolded before him.</p>

<p>Chuck, his clothes heavy with dust, reined
in beside Slim.</p>

<p>“Better ease up a little,” said the Circle Four
rider. “This pace is a little more than my
cayuse can stand on a day as hot as this.</p>

<p>“We’ve been hitting it pretty hard,” conceded
Slim, “but I wanted to get to Dirty
Water before sundown. Unless I miss my
guess the village is only a couple of miles further.”
Slim pointed toward the left, where
a cluster of frame buildings could be seen
strewn along the banks of a stream.</p>

<p>“It may be the Box B,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. The Box B is closer to
the Three Soldiers. Whatever it is, we’ll know
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Slim spoke to Lightning and the magnificent
sorrel started down the slight grade, apparently
as fresh and tireless as when they had taken the
trail early in the day.</p>

<p>As they neared the buildings, Slim was convinced
that they were approaching Dirty
Water and he wondered just what kind of a
reception was in store for them. Old Bill
Needham had said the village was the headquarters
of the rustlers.</p>

<p>Dirty Water was anything but impressive.
It was a typical cow town. Most of the buildings
were unpainted, their cracked boards
burned a dead gray by the heat of summer and
the chill blasts of winter.</p>

<p>Slim and Chuck pulled up on their side of
the creek and surveyed the town with critical
eyes. There was only one street, the buildings
fronting along the creek and set back about
fifty yards from the edge of the stream. Many
of the frame structures had false fronts, giving
them the appearance of two story buildings.
There were not more than fifteen or sixteen
buildings in Dirty Water.</p>

<p>“Wonder where the town got its name?”
mused Chuck, looking down at the stream
which flowed in front of them. It was clear
and blue--the blue of waters from the high
peaks of the Three Soldiers. “It couldn’t have
been from this creek.”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave that information for you to dig
out,” grinned Slim. “Come on. I’m hungry,
tired and dirty. There’s one place over there
that claims to be a hotel.”</p>

<p>They forded the stream and their horses
mounted the sloping bank to the main street.
Half way down the row of buildings a two-story
structure reared its head. A faded sign
proclaimed “Palace Hotel” and to the rear was
a rambling stable and large corral.</p>

<p>In spite of their own weariness from the long,
hot day in the saddle, their horses came first.</p>

<p>A hostler appeared from the shadows of the
stable as they dismounted and Slim turned
Lightning over to his care.</p>

<p>“How much for the horses?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“Going to stay at the hotel?” asked the
stableman.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Chuck nodded.</p>

<p>“Half a dollar for each horse then.”</p>

<p>The price was fair enough and Slim and
Chuck unfastened their saddles and rifle scabbards.
They were taking no risks on the honesty
of anyone at Dirty Water. The hostler
looked at Lightning with open admiration.</p>

<p>“Fine looking horse,” he said. “Must be
mighty fast.”</p>

<p>“Fair,” agreed Slim, “but getting a little old
to keep up a hard trail gait very long. See that
she’s given the best of care.”</p>

<p>The cowboys picked up their duffel and
headed toward the hotel.</p>

<p>“What was the idea telling the hostler Lightning
was old and losing her speed?” asked
Chuck.</p>

<p>“There’s just a chance we may find our lives
depending on Lightning’s speed and there’s no
use in tipping off anyone how fast she really
can run when I give her a chance.”</p>

<p>“In other words, we’ll sit tight and let the
other fellows do the talking while we’re here,”
grinned Chuck.</p>

<p>“Exactly. I’m hungry. Let’s hope the
hotel doesn’t live up to the name of the town.”</p>

<p>They clumped across the narrow stoop in
front of the hotel and entered the small room
which served as a lobby. A fat, bald-headed
man who had been swatting flies looked around
from behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Bed and board?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Providing there’s no bugs in either one,”
said Chuck.</p>

<p>The fat man’s face turned red and he sputtered
furiously.</p>

<p>“Tha--, tha--, that’s an insult to the Palace
Hotel,” he finally managed to say. “I
never yet been accused of harboring a bed bug
in my place.”</p>

<p>“No offense meant,” grinned Chuck. “I
was just being cautious.”</p>

<p>The hotel man shoved a well thumbed ledger
across the counter. A rusty pen and half
empty bottle of ink followed.</p>

<p>“Sign your monickers here,” he said, indicating
several blank spaces near the bottom
of the page.</p>

<p>Slim picked up the pen and looked at the
names which had been signed before him. According
to the register, the last guest, Maxie
Denkman, had visited the hotel three months
before. Slim looked again at the name on the
register. “Maxie,” the name clicked. It was
the one the riders on the Sky High trail had
mentioned as the man he had shot in the fight
near the summit when Chuck had been ambushed.
Here indeed was a clue to the mystery
of the rustling in the Creeping Shadows. It
might be worth only a little, but Slim carefully
cataloged it in his mind for future reference.</p>

<p>“Not much travel through here,” he said,
pointing to the name which had been placed
on the book three months before.</p>

<p>“Not enough,” grunted the hotel keeper.
“Still, with the riders coming in off the range,
I manage to get along.”</p>

<p>“Country seems right healthy,” said Chuck,
glancing through the dust-fogged windows
toward the broad expanse of the valley.</p>

<p>“Some inquisitive people have been known
to have a touch of lead poisoning,” said the
hotel man sharply.</p>

<p>Slim signed his name and handed the pen to
Chuck. The Flying Arrow rider scratched his
name with gusto and felt sure that no one
would be able to read the scrawl.</p>

<p>“You fellers didn’t put down your addresses,”
said their host.</p>

<p>Slim looked at him calmly, yet when he
spoke his voice was low.</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “is none of your business.”
The hotel keeper decided that as far as he was
concerned the newcomers could be only one
jump ahead of a sheriff.</p>

<p>He handed a key over the counter. “Your
room’s No. 3 on the left side as you go down
the hall.”</p>

<p>Slim and Chuck picked up their saddles and
ascended the stairs. The hallway was narrow,
hot, and poorly lighted, but they found the
door of their own room.</p>

<p>The room was furnished in the usual fashion
of a cow country hotel. The bed was of cast
iron, the other furnishings being two straight-backed
chairs and a wash stand that stood at a
crazy angle. The mirror above it, like the windows,
had not been cleaned in months and there
was a smell of mustiness about the room.</p>

<p>Slim threw open the one window and a light
breeze from the east riffled the remnants of
what had once been a curtain.</p>

<p>Chuck tested the bed.</p>

<p>“Not bad,” he said, “and the sheets are
clean.”</p>

<p>There was no water in the pitcher on the
washstand but the portly keeper of the hostelry
appeared with a bucketful.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t looking for any business today,” he
said as he filled the water pitcher. “Here’s a
towel, too. Supper will be ready in about
fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>He paused at the door.</p>

<p>“Anything you need?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Solitude,” said Chuck.</p>

<p>The door slammed hard behind the retreating
figure.</p>

<p>Slim laughed and then sobered as he turned
to Chuck.</p>

<p>“You’re deliberately stirring that old chap
up,” he said. “What’s the idea?”</p>

<p>“Nothing special. I just don’t like his looks.
Maybe I can worry a little of the excess fat off
him.”</p>

<p>“If you keep up at the rate you started, he’ll
be a skeleton by tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>They washed the grime of the day’s ride off
and Slim surveyed the washbowl with distaste.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to see where they got the name
‘Dirty Water’ for this town.”</p>

<p>The clang of a bell sounded below and
shortly after footsteps thudded heavily on the
stoop.</p>

<p>“We’d better get down there ahead of the
army,” said Chuck, throwing open the door of
their own room and starting down the stairs.
Slim followed, but at a more leisurely pace.
He had heard someone moving about in the
next room and he was curious to know what
their neighbor looked like. The door opened
and a man, dressed in typical cowboy attire,
stepped into the hall. His right arm was in a
sling. There was scarcely enough light to see
his features clearly in the dusk of the hall, but
Slim felt certain that the man was Maxie Denkman,
who had registered three months before.
He was also the Maxie he had wounded on the
Sky High trail.</p>

<p>“Pretty hot today,” said Slim as the other
man approached.</p>

<p>“Yeh, a little warm. I guess I saw you riding
in a while ago.”</p>

<p>They were at the head of the stairs where the
light was better and Slim saw that the other
man was watching him keenly. His eyes
shifted down to the gun, which swung at Slim’s
right hip. Then they jerked back again.</p>

<p>“Going to stay in this country long?” Slim
thought there was just a tinge too much anxiety
in the tone.</p>

<p>“Hard to say. My pardner and I are just
drifting, trying to find a good outfit to tie up
with.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t hang around here long.
Cattle business in the valley is in a bad way. I
hear lots of talk about rustlers, but I guess it’s
poor management more than anything.”</p>

<p>“We’re willing to work cheap if the outfit
looks like it will come through,” said Slim.</p>

<p>They reached the bottom of the stairs and
turned into the dining room. Half a dozen
men were already seated at the one table and the
food was disappearing at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>Chuck had his own plate heaped high and
Slim soon had his filled with food. There was
little conversation. That would come later
when appetites were satisfied and they sat back
and waited for the pie to be brought on.</p>

<p>The man Slim had met in the hall was making
slow work of his supper, for he was greatly
handicapped with the use of only his left hand.
He paused and looked at Slim.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe I know your name or did I
miss it coming downstairs?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mention it. Name’s Evans, Slim
Evans. My pardner’s Chuck Meade.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you. I’m Maxie Denkman.
Meet the rest of the outfit here.”</p>

<p>He turned to his left and introduced the
group at the table. There was Pike Carberry,
who ran the general store, and his clerk, Jim
Ferris, who also did the barbering for the whole
valley. Next was Leo Kovec, whose star on
his vest proclaimed him to be the marshal and
beyond him sat Newt Bemis, whom Denkman
introduced as an assistant cattle buyer. The
man at the end of the table drew Slim’s attention.
He was well groomed in spite in the heat
of the day, immaculately shaved, and his linen
was fresh and white. His dark hair was slightly
curly and he had a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“I’ll introduce myself,” he said. “I’m Hal
Titzell, cattle buyer.”</p>

<p>“Glad to know you,” said Slim, and Chuck
echoed the words. Just then the pie was placed
on the table and conversation died.</p>

<p>Between mouthfuls of pie, Slim mentally
gauged the group at the table.</p>

<p>Pike Carberry, genial, white-haired and
sixty, was just what he appeared to be--the
town storekeeper. Jim Ferris, slightly bald
and about thirty-five, was talkative.</p>

<p>Leo Kovec, the marshal, was about forty,
heavy of face and figure and Slim put him
down as mentally slow, although he might be
the local agent of the rustlers.</p>

<p>Newt Bemis looked plain bad. His features
were heavily lined and a livid scar disfigured
the right cheek. The brand, “Gunman,” was
written all over him and for that reason Slim
put him down as both interesting and dangerous.
He was also the Newt who had tried to
bushwhack Chuck on the trail.</p>

<p>Maxie Denkman, in introducing the others,
had failed to mention his own business, but
Slim knew he was allied with the rustlers.</p>

<p>The last man and the hardest of them all to
catalog was Hal Titzell. He might be thirty-five
and again he might be almost fifty. His
skin was a clear tan, and his hands and fingernails
much better kept than the average. He
might be a cattle buyer, but Slim also put him
down as a gambler, a man of rare courage and
ability, which also meant an exceedingly dangerous
man.</p>

<p>The pie finished, the group pushed their
chairs away from the table and went to the
stoop, where a dozen chairs were ranged along
the wall of the hotel.</p>

<p>The sun had dropped behind the Three Soldiers
and shadows were thickening. Titzell sat
down beside Slim and pointed across the valley.</p>

<p>“Watch the shadows and you’ll see why this
country is known as the Creeping Shadows.”</p>

<p>The shadows from the foothills of the Three
Soldiers were extending further into the valley
in a steady, visible movement. They were
alive, creeping out and out until the entire
basin was folded in their softness. Hard behind
them came the deeper cloak of the night.
Down the street a light flared in the window of
Pike Carberry’s general store and further along
raucous voices sounded in the Elite Pool Hall.
Several horses splashed across the creek and
their riders disappeared inside the portals of the
pool hall.</p>

<p>“Quiet night,” said Titzell. “Things liven
up Saturdays when the boys come in off the
range.”</p>

<p>“You must get around the country quite
a bit. Maybe you know where they’re needing
help.”</p>

<p>“Most of the outfits are cutting down instead
of adding men on the payroll,” said Titzell
smoothly. “The Box B, Adam Marks’ outfit,
claims to be having trouble with rustlers, so
you might get on with him but it would be a
chance I wouldn’t want to take if what Adam
says is true.”</p>

<p>Slim wondered if Titzell was giving him a
friendly warning or trying to scare him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t figure there was much rustling
being done these days,” said Slim.</p>

<p>“All I know is the talk that’s current in the
valley. Adam claims he’s being stolen blind
and of course that makes all of the other
ranchers touchy. They think he’s accusing
them of being cattle thieves because Adam has
the biggest outfit.”</p>

<p>“It looks like good cattle country.”</p>

<p>“There’s none better in the world,” said Titzell
softly. “It would be a prize worth risking
your life to get. Adam Marks once had the
chance to control the whole valley, but he’s
getting older and losing his grip. The man
who succeeds the Box B can run this little cattle
empire about as he desires.”</p>

<p>“Unless,” thought Slim to himself, “he happens
to be an ambitious rustler and runs up
against the law.”</p>

<p>Chuck, who had been making a tour of the
town, returned and dropped into a chair beside
Slim. It was quiet and peaceful, a far cry from
the bitter cattle war which Old Bill Needham
had told them was raging in the valley. They
talked for another half hour with Titzell and
were about to go up to their room when the
sound of wildly drumming hoofs came from
across the creek.</p>

<p>“Someone’s coming mighty fast,” said Titzell,
half rising from his chair and shielding his
eyes in an attempt to peer into the darkness beyond
the creek.</p>

<p>“Two horses,” said Chuck, adding quickly,
“they’re pulling a wagon of some kind.”</p>

<p>“Must be from one of the ranches, then,”
put in Titzell. The cattle buyer stood up and
hurried down toward the creek. Slim and
Chuck followed.</p>

<p>Out of the night lurched a lather-covered
team, a spring wagon careening behind them.
The horses fairly leaped the stream and started
a mad dash up the bank.</p>

<p>Chuck without waiting to learn who was in
the wagon or what was happening, hurled himself
at the team, grasping the bit of the horse
on the left. The Circle Four cowboy was
lifted from his feet by the wild charge of the
horses, but he came down with his legs in motion
and dragging hard on the bit. It was 195
pounds of bone and muscle against a tired team,
and Chuck soon won, the horses slowing down
to a walk. They came to a halt in front of the
hotel where the feeble light from the lamp in
the main room cast its rays over the wagon,
where a man was huddled on the seat.</p>

<p>Hal Titzell vaulted into the wagon and
lifted the man’s face.</p>

<p>“It’s Adam Marks,” he cried. “He’s been
shot.”</p>

<p>The words drummed into Slim’s brain.
Adam Marks, owner of the Box B and the man
they had come to help, had been shot! The
rustlers were striking out boldly, bidding for
a quick finish in their fight to ruin the rancher
and win control of his rich grazing lands.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch11' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Eleven</span><br /> <br />Slim Rides Alone</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim vaulted over the wheel and into the
wagon. He picked up the body of the rancher
and passed the inert form down to Chuck.
The news of the runaway spread rapidly and
a crowd was gathering. Hal Titzell shouted
for the doctor and the only physician in the
entire valley, “Doc” Baldridge, appeared in
the doorway of his office, a half block down the
street from the Palace Hotel.</p>

<p>“Bring him over here,” he called.</p>

<p>Chuck, carrying the unconscious rancher,
hurried to the physician’s office where he placed
Adam Marks on the old cot. The white hair
of the cattleman was streaked with dried blood
and his breathing was slow and irregular.</p>

<p>“Looks bad,” said Hal Titzell, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>Slim was watching the doctor, now working
over his patient with practiced hands. He
called for hot water from the hotel and a bystander
hurried away to return shortly with a
steaming kettle of water.</p>

<p>There was nothing Slim and Chuck could
do in the doctor’s office and they stepped outside.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that the team’s cared for,” said
Chuck, leading the exhausted animals back
toward the stable.</p>

<p>Slim, leaning against the hitching rail in
front of the doctor’s office, stared into the
blackness across Stony creek, wondering what
secret it held of the attack which had struck
down the cattleman. Chuck returned presently
and they conversed in low tones.</p>

<p>“I found his rifle and revolver in the bottom
of the wagon,” said Chuck. “The six gun
must have fallen out of his holster. Neither
one had been fired, which means he was ambushed.”</p>

<p>“I expected as much. The gang we’re up
against doesn’t give a man a chance.”</p>

<p>Slim paused suddenly. Hal Titzell emerged
from the doctor’s office.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“A little too early to say definitely,” replied
the cattle buyer. “Adam’s been creased pretty
deeply by a rifle bullet along the right side of
his head. Doc thinks he may pull through but
it’s going to be tough going.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we ought to ride outside and get a
better doctor,” suggested Chuck, who had little
faith in Dirty Water or anyone connected
with it.</p>

<p>“No need to do that,” assured Titzell.
“Doc Baldridge may not look like much, but
when it comes to fixing up gunshot wounds he’s
a marvel.”</p>

<p>It was evident that it would be a good many
hours before Adam Marks regained consciousness
and could tell what had happened, so the
small group gradually dispersed leaving Slim
and Chuck.</p>

<p>“You’d better roll in,” said Slim. “I’m
going to hang around until I can find what’s
happened.”</p>

<p>“All night?”</p>

<p>“If necessary. If the fellow that wounded
him finds he didn’t do a thorough job, he may
decide to sneak back and finish him.”</p>

<p>Chuck whistled softly. “That’s an idea.
Tell you what. I’ll turn in for a few hours and
then come down around two and relieve you.”</p>

<p>Chuck went to the hotel and Slim re-entered
the doctor’s office. Doc Baldridge had drawn
a chair up beside a table on which a kerosene
lamp burned softly. On the cot across the
room was the motionless form of the owner of
the Box B.</p>

<p>“One of Adam’s riders?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Nope. Just drifting and looking for a
job. I’d kind of hoped to get on with the Box
B.”</p>

<p>Doc Baldridge laid down his book and stared
thoughtfully at Slim over his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool,” he said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I said. It’s doggoned near fatal
to start riding for the Box B these days. Look
what happened to the owner of the outfit.”
He jerked his thumb toward the rancher.</p>

<p>“If the pay’s good, I’m willing to take the
chance,” grinned Slim. “I’ll just stick around
and when he comes to he may be crazy enough
to hire me and my pardner.”</p>

<p>Doc Baldridge resumed his reading and Slim
sat down beside the wounded man to begin
what might be an all night vigil.</p>

<p>Hal Titzell looked in an hour later.</p>

<p>“You must want a job,” he said to Slim.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get one if patience will bring
it,” grinned the Flying Arrow puncher.</p>

<p>“Maybe I could find something for you to
do,” suggested Titzell.</p>

<p>“Thanks. If this doesn’t pan out, I may be
around.”</p>

<p>The cattle buyer left and Doc Baldridge,
without looking up from his book, spoke
softly.</p>

<p>“Keep away from Titzell. He’s poison.”</p>

<p>Slim smiled and gave no sign that he had
heard the warning from the doctor. He had
already put the suave Titzell down as a dangerous
man.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o’clock when Adam Marks
opened his eyes. His fever had dropped and his
mind seemed clear. Slim spoke to the doctor,
who shut his book and went to the cot.</p>

<p>“How about it, doc?” asked the cattleman.</p>

<p>“You’re too tough for one rifle bullet to
kill,” replied the doctor, “but you’re going to
be laid up for a few days. What happened?”</p>

<p>“Bushwhacked,” was the slow reply. “It
was almost dark and just at the mouth of Wolf
coulee. The first shot missed me. I started for
my gun but the second one got me. How’d I
get here?”</p>

<p>“The team brought you in. They must
have run all of the way. Good thing they did.”</p>

<p>“This will leave the boys at the ranch in a
tough spot,” said Marks.</p>

<p>“Maybe you could use a couple of extra
hands,” said Slim hopefully.</p>

<p>“I could if they were good, honest men.”</p>

<p>“I’m one of them and I’ll vouch for my pardner.
I’m off the Flying Arrow and he’s from
the Circle Four. We want work.”</p>

<p>“There’s more than work at my ranch.
There’s apt to be fighting soon. I’m being
stolen blind and the day I catch up with the
rustlers there’s going to be bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work and fight for an honest boss.”</p>

<p>The cattleman seemed to be mulling something
over in his mind. Then he asked, “You
say you’re off the Flying Arrow?”</p>

<p>Slim nodded.</p>

<p>“Fellow named Evans used to own that outfit.
Maybe you know him.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Evans. I’m his son.”</p>

<p>Marks’ eyes twinkled beneath the heavy
bandage.</p>

<p>“Then you’re hired and so is your friend. I
wish I could get a dozen more like you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll need a dozen more,”
said Slim quietly. “I’ll start for the ranch now
and my pardner will come down and stay with
you. When he thinks it’s safe to leave you,
give him any orders you have and he’ll ride
out.”</p>

<p>“Joe Haines is my riding boss. Tell Joe I
sent you. I’ve only got four men now. Others
have either been shot up or scared away, but I
guess you won’t scare.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to run,” grinned Slim.</p>

<p>The Flying Arrow rider left the doctor’s
office and hurried to the hotel. A dim light was
burning in the lobby, but there was no one
about. He shook Chuck out of a deep sleep and
informed him that they were on the payroll of
the Box B.</p>

<p>“Have any trouble getting on?” asked
Chuck.</p>

<p>“Not a bit. I told him where I was from
and he’s heard of Dad. I’m starting for the
ranch now. You stay here and keep watch on
Marks. He’ll be safe enough in the day time
but don’t let him out of your sight at night.”</p>

<p>Chuck pulled on his clothes, examined his
six gun and rifle, and prepared to take up his
vigil at the doctor’s office.</p>

<p>The cowboy detectives parted outside the
hotel.</p>

<p>“Watch your step,” cautioned Chuck. “I
don’t want to see you brought into Doc Baldridge’s
office with a hole through you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” promised Slim.</p>

<p>The Flying Arrow rider wakened the stableman
and inquired the way to the Box B.</p>

<p>“It’s a nine mile trip, but the trail’s clear.
You’ll strike it just across the creek.”</p>

<p>Slim’s low whistle brought Lightning out
of the corral and he saddled and bridled the
mare with expert hands. He slipped his rifle
into the scabbard on the saddle and swung
silently into the stirrups.</p>

<p>Dirty Water appeared asleep with only the
dim light in the hotel and the glow from the
windows of Doc Baldridge’s trying to penetrate
the blackness of the night. It was the
hour just before the dawn when Slim set out
for the Box B.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch12' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Twelve</span><br /> <br />War Declared</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dawn had broken over the crests of the Cajons
and smoke was curling above the cookhouse
when Slim rode down on the Box B. The ranch
buildings were set almost in the shadows of the
Three Soldiers, the towering peaks looming
above the huddled structures at their feet.</p>

<p>The foothills rose some miles behind the
ranch, but the buildings themselves were in a
broad, rich valley. A fringe of cottonwoods
growing rank along a creek protected the layout
from the winter winds which swept down
from the north.</p>

<p>The ranch house, a rambling frame structure,
had once been painted gray, but wind and
rain had worn this to a sickly hue. The other
buildings, including the bunkhouse, the cookhouse,
and the blacksmith shop, were unpainted,
their boards warped and burned by
the sun.</p>

<p>A large corral was just below the buildings
with a score of horses inside. Beyond was a
rich meadow through which the creek wandered,
and the grass there was thick and green.
Stacks of hay, cut for winter use, were ranged
along one side. It was an ideal layout and Slim
could understand the pride of Adam Marks in
the Box B and its rich, rolling miles of range
land. He could understand, with the spirit
of a true cowman, how a man would fight to
the end to retain his possessions in this last stand
of the cattle frontier.</p>

<p>Slim spoke to Lightning and the sorrel
quickened her pace. As he rode past the pole
corral, men poured out of the bunkhouse to
watch his approach.</p>

<p>Slim pulled Lightning up several rods from
the bunkhouse and surveyed the Box B riders
with a cool eye. It was easy to pick out Joe
Haines, the foreman. He was a typical cowboy,
head slightly bald as though singed by too
much exposure to the sun and face as brown as
saddle leather. He could claim any age from
forty to fifty, and Slim would have been willing
to guess that he was closer to fifty. The
others were younger, but he noticed that every
one of them carried guns and well-filled cartridge
belts.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Joe Haines,” said Slim. “I
have news for him.”</p>

<p>“You’re looking at him,” said the foreman,
stepping forward.</p>

<p>Slim leaned over in his saddle and looked into
the foreman’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Your boss was shot last night,” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Joe, stunned by
the words.</p>

<p>“Adam Marks was shot last night. His team
brought him to Dirty Water and Doc Baldridge
patched him up.”</p>

<p>“How bad was he hurt?” a younger cowboy
edged forward with this question.</p>

<p>“A rifle ball creased one side of his forehead.
He was unconscious for a while, but Doc
thinks he’ll pull through.”</p>

<p>“Where did it happen?” asked Haines, hitching
his gun belt forward.</p>

<p>“Marks said it was at the mouth of Wolf
coulee, wherever that is.”</p>

<p>Joe Haines nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s a bad place. Come on, boys. We’re
riding for Dirty Water.”</p>

<p>Slim spoke quickly.</p>

<p>“Just a minute. I had a talk with your boss
before I left town. He wants you to stick at
the ranch and watch the cattle. Maybe this
is just a ruse to get you all away so the rustlers
can clean out the place.”</p>

<p>Pausing, the foreman turned back toward
Slim. “Who in thunder are you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Name’s Evans--Slim Evans. I’ve been
riding over on the Flying Arrow. Been hired
and told to report to you for work. My pardner,
Chuck Meade, is staying in Dirty Water
and he’s camped right beside your boss, so you
won’t need to worry about anything happening
to him there.”</p>

<p>“How do I know you’re telling a straight
story?” countered the range boss.</p>

<p>“You’ve got my word for it and people don’t
question my word,” said Slim quietly. He
straightened up in his saddle and his right hand
slipped along his leg.</p>

<p>Joe Haines saw the move and a broad smile
covered his homely features.</p>

<p>“No offense meant, cowboy, but we’ve had
so much trouble I’m just naturally suspicious
of everyone who comes along. We’ll take your
word. Better turn your horse loose. Breakfast
will be ready in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Slim rode down to the corral, pulled his saddle
off Lightning and turned the sorrel loose.
There was plenty of water and feed in the corral
and, satisfied that his horse was all right,
Slim returned to the bunkhouse where the
cowboys were finishing their morning toilets
under the pump.</p>

<p>“Meet the gang, or what’s left of them,”
said Haines. “Here’s Pat Beals, Doug Huston
and Walt Kelly.”</p>

<p>Slim shook hands with the outfit as the
breakfast bell clanged. A Chinese cook, Lee
Wu, brought steaming bowls of breakfast
food, a pitcher of black coffee, and then stacks
of cakes and bacon. There was little conversation
as the cowboys stowed away enough food
to carry them through the day if need be.</p>

<p>Slim made a survey of his companions while
they were eating. Pat Beals and Walt Kelly
were only a little older than himself and there
was a reckless glint in their eyes. Doug Huston
was sandy-haired and Slim put him down as
probably thirty. His left eyelid drooped
slightly and he seemed to be continually squinting.
He was the least likeable of the group and
Slim felt that he could not be trusted altogether.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, they gathered outside the
cook house and Joe Haines issued orders for the
day.</p>

<p>“Pat, you and Doug ride along the west
range and see how those cattle along Stony
creek are faring. Walt can trail over north and
see if everything is all right toward the Double
O. I’ll take Evans and ride down to Wolf
coulee and see what happened there last night.”</p>

<p>They started for the corral, Slim and the
range boss walking together.</p>

<p>“Your horse fit for a full day?” asked
Haines.</p>

<p>“She’ll be all right,” smiled Slim as he
thought of Lightning’s wonderful endurance.
There was no need to tell anyone of the capabilities
of his horse.</p>

<p>While the others had to rope their mounts to
separate them from the milling string of horses
in the corral, Slim only whistled once and
Lightning responded instantly.</p>

<p>“My gosh!” exclaimed Pat Beals enviously.
“You must have a circus horse. I can yell my
head off and I can’t get any of my mounts to
come near me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they don’t like your voice,” suggested
Walt Kelly, who had just finished a battle
with a calico cayuse and was badly winded.</p>

<p>They swung into their saddles and started
out on the day’s ride, Pat and Doug heading
west to ride along the headwaters of Stony
creek, Walt riding north toward the range of
the Double O and Slim and the foreman backtracking
along the trail to Dirty Water.</p>

<p>Joe Haines was openly admiring Lightning.</p>

<p>“Quite a horse,” he said. “Must be fast?”</p>

<p>“She can go places,” grinned Slim, but he
did not encourage the conversation along that
line.</p>

<p>“Have any trouble getting into the Creeping
Shadows country?” asked the foreman.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Rustling’s bad here and we’d heard that the
gang doing most of the dirty work had plugged
up every trail coming in and were getting ready
for a final clean-up.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been here long enough to find out
what’s going on,” said Slim, which was partly
true. “If rustling is bad, why not appeal to
the peace officers?”</p>

<p>The foreman snorted. “The sheriff’s on the
other side of the Three Soldiers and he’s either
been bought off or is scared to death.”</p>

<p>“How about the marshal at Dirty Water?”</p>

<p>Haines laughed bitterly. “Kovec’s nothing
but a tool for the rustlers. It’s a wonder you
ever got out here alive.”</p>

<p>“I left when the town was asleep,” grinned
Slim.</p>

<p>“That town never sleeps. It’s bad from top
to bottom and Hal Titzell is one of the worst
of them. He rides all over the country but I
never heard of him ever buying any stock to
amount to anything and Maxie Denkman and
Newt Bemis, who say they’re helping him, are
nothing but hired gunmen.”</p>

<p>“Maxie isn’t feeling so well,” said Slim.</p>

<p>“How come?”</p>

<p>“Well, from what I gather, Maxie and his
friend Newt must have tried to stop a couple
of cowboys from riding into the valley. Seems
as though they picked the wrong targets and
Maxie got a bullet through his arm.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t know who shot at Maxie,
would you?” Haines asked, a broad grin wrinkling
his face.</p>

<p>“I might,” smiled Slim, “and then again I
might not. I’ve got a bad memory.”</p>

<p>“I think we’re going to get along fine,” said
the foreman, “and I’m only hoping that pardner
of yours is the right kind of a hombre.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about him. He’s as steady as
they make them and a dead shot with a rifle.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m starting to take heart again. For
a while it looked like we would be cleaned out,
but with a couple of good riders who’ve got
plenty of nerve and aren’t afraid of a struggle,
we’ll fight this gang of rustlers to the end.”</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch13' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Thirteen</span><br /> <br />Fading Trails</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The ride to the mouth of Wolf coulee was uneventful
and the sun was swinging high above
the Cajons when they reached the scene where
the owner of the Box B had been ambushed the
night before.</p>

<p>The mouth of Wolf coulee was broad with
the trail from the ranch to Dirty Water down
the center of the draw. An outcropping of rock
thrust its way into the coulee from the right
and it was obvious that from the shelter of
the rock the gunman had fired at Adam Marks.</p>

<p>The riders slipped from their saddles and
picked their way carefully over the broken
ground, Slim taking the lead.</p>

<p>“It must have been almost dark when it happened,”
said Slim, “for it was some time after
nightfall when the horses came galloping into
Dirty Water.”</p>

<p>The foreman nodded. “He left the ranch
half an hour before sunset and packing quite a
roll of cash with him.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any cash when he was brought
into the doctor’s office.”</p>

<p>“Probably not. The rustlers must have
reached him after they had wounded him and
taken the money. Adam was afraid to keep
the money on the ranch and he was going to
go around Dirty Water and drive all night to
get to Mopstick where he could catch a train
and take the money to the bank at Brighton.”</p>

<p>“If the money was in your boss’s clothes
when he reached the doctor’s office, it’s safe,
for Chuck’s on the job,” said Slim.</p>

<p>There was a warning whir of rattles and
Joe Haines called out sharply.</p>

<p>Slim leaped backward, his gun spouting
flame. Two shots echoed across the coulee and
the body of the rattler slipped off the rock.</p>

<p>The foreman looked incredulously at Slim.</p>

<p>“Where you carrying your gun, in your
hand?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Slim, feeding fresh shells into
the six gun and sliding the weapon back into
his holster.</p>

<p>Joe Haines asked no further question but in
his own mind he cataloged Slim as the fastest
man he had ever seen with a gun. The weapon
had been drawn with a skill so fast and smooth
that it defied the eye. It was almost like magic,
the sweep of that long arm and the accurate
spurt of the weapon.</p>

<p>“Here’s where our bushwhacker made himself
comfortable,” said Slim, pointing behind
a rock where a half dozen cigarette butts were
strewn. He leaned down and picked up an
exploded rifle shell. Turning it over slowly in
his fingers, he looked at the mark of the firing
pin on the base. Then he slipped the copper
cartridge into an inner pocket. It might come
in handy later.</p>

<p>A few rods further back they found where
the gunman’s horse had been tethered and there
was evidence written in the dust there that the
rider had mounted in great haste.</p>

<p>“He must have been afraid someone had
overheard the shot and was coming after him.
He sure tore out of here,” said Joe Haines.</p>

<p>“Maybe he started out to overtake Adam
Marks and get the money,” said Slim.</p>

<p>“By golly, I’ll bet you’re right! We’ll get
our horses and follow this trail.”</p>

<p>Slim’s hunch was correct, and a short distance
further the tracks left by the lone rider
merged into the dust of the main trail to Dirty
Water. The gunman had been riding hard,
but the team, spurred on by an unknown fear,
had been too fast for him.</p>

<p>A mile and a half along the road to Dirty
Water the trail of the solitary rider swung to
the right toward the Three Soldiers.</p>

<p>“Want to follow it?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“I’m more anxious about the money. That
trail won’t cool off for a few hours. We’re riding
to Dirty Water.”</p>

<p>It was mid morning when they reached the
cow town. They splashed across Stony creek
and tied their horses to the rail in front of Doc
Baldridge’s office. Chuck emerged from the
interior and Slim noticed that he was careful to
keep his rifle in his hands.</p>

<p>“Anything happen?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Something tried to happen,” said Chuck
grimly. “This is no place for a sick man to try
to get well. We’ve got to get Mr. Marks back
to the ranch and get him there at once.”</p>

<p>“This is my pardner, Chuck Meade,” said
Slim, introducing his companion and the range
boss of the Box B.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you,” said Chuck, as he
shook Joe Haines’ hand with real warmth.</p>

<p>“Hear you’ve signed on to work with us and
I’m glad of it. We need all the good boys we
can get.”</p>

<p>The foreman hurried on into the office and
Slim and Chuck had an opportunity to talk
alone.</p>

<p>“What happened?” Slim asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“You mean what didn’t quite happen?
Well, it was about half an hour after you left
and I was still trying to wake up when I heard
someone creeping along outside the front of
the office. We had all of the curtains pulled
down but it was so hot we had to leave the door
open. I blew out the lamp and jumped
through the doorway. In the darkness I stumbled
and when I got up the hombre that had
been trying to do the sneak act was running
down the street past the hotel. I let him have a
few slugs to stir things up, but I missed him.”</p>

<p>“You think he was after Marks?”</p>

<p>“I know it. Here’s what I found outside
this morning. The fellow was in such a hurry
he dropped it.”</p>

<p>Chuck pulled out a revolver which he had
stuck in the belt of his trousers.</p>

<p>“We were afraid something like this might
have happened. Joe Haines told me his boss
was taking some cash to the bank at Brighton
and had planned to ride around Dirty Water in
the night and take the train at Mopstick. You
see any money on him?”</p>

<p>Just then Joe Haines emerged from the Doctor’s
office.</p>

<p>“If one of you boys will go around to the
stable and get the team ready, we’ll start for
the ranch. We’re taking the boss home. The
money is safe.”</p>

<p>“Good thing,” said Chuck. “I’ll get the
team.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they carried the owner
of the Box B out of the office and placed him
on a mattress in the bottom of the wagon. Slim
had settled for their room at the hotel and at
the same time had made the purchase of the
mattress. Joe Haines took the reins of the team
while Slim had a lead rope on Joe’s horse.
They eased across the shallow bed of Stony
creek and started the dusty ride to the ranch.</p>

<p>As they moved away from Dirty Water,
Slim turned in his saddle. Hal Titzell, immaculately
dressed, was standing on the stoop
of the Palace Hotel, watching the small cavalcade
and Slim thought that the expression on
the face of the cattle buyer was anything but
pleasant.</p>

<p>They made slow progress, Joe Haines driving
carefully to ease the jolts for the injured
man on the mattress. Slim rode alongside the
wagon and conversed with Joe.</p>

<p>“If it’s all right with you, I’m going to swing
off the main trail and see if I can follow the
fellow who did the shooting last night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” urged Joe. “If you catch up
with him, treat him like you did the rattlesnake
this morning.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Slim turned away from
the trail to the ranch and headed more
directly toward the Three Soldiers. He had
little difficulty in following the trail for the
rider had been pushing his horse hard.</p>

<p>Slim swung along at an easy lope, a pace that
Lightning could hold all day. The trail was
leading into the foothills of the Three Soldiers
and shortly after midday Slim stopped beside
a creek to allow Lightning to drink and graze.
He had no food for himself, but breakfast at
the Box B had been hearty enough to ward off
the pangs of hunger until nightfall.</p>

<p>It was mid afternoon when Slim found the
place where the unknown rider had stopped to
rest himself and his mount. A handful of ashes
were still warm and he pushed on with renewed
hope. His quarry could not be more than three
hours’ ride ahead and on a horse that should be
tiring rapidly.</p>

<p>Slim leaped off Lightning and got down to
examine the tracks he was following. He
wanted the memory of the hoof marks stamped
indelibly on his mind. Somewhere in the valley
he might come across them again even
though the coming night might let his quarry
escape this time. The left rear shoe had a V-shaped
nick that made it easily recognizable
anywhere and after studying the other tracks
for some outstanding characteristic, Slim remounted
Lightning and pushed steadily ahead.
The pace was faster now, and the sturdy sorrel
seemed to scent that a chase was on.</p>

<p>They had been climbing for the last two
hours and Slim knew that they were well behind
and above the Box B layout. It was half
an hour before sunset when, from a promontory,
he looked down on the ranch buildings,
snuggled in the rich valley which was the heart
of the Box B.</p>

<p>As the shadows deepened in the Three
Soldiers, Slim knew that his quarry was safe
for the night. In spite of Lightning’s superior
speed and the ease with which he had been able
to follow the trail, it would be impossible to
overtake the rider ahead.</p>

<p>Slim watered Lightning at a mountain
stream and pondered what to do next. It
would be a hard ride down to the ranch, but
he was hungry. On the other hand, if he
stayed in the foothills, he could press on the
first thing in the morning, perhaps overtaking
the man he sought before he struck the trail
again.</p>

<p>Slim’s innate stubbornness and determination
to stick to a job until the end finally decided
him and he made a crude camp beside the
tiny stream. There was plenty of grass for
Lightning, but Slim went hungry for the second
meal that day. He hitched his belt a trifle
tighter and unrolled his blanket.</p>

<p>With the first streak of dawn over the distant
Cajons, he had Lightning saddled and
ready for the trail. An hour later he came upon
the overnight camp of the unknown rider and
his heart leaped. The trail was getting hot.
Another hour and he should be within striking
distance.</p>

<p>Slim felt that if he could but overtake the
gunman who had shot down the owner of the
Box B, he would have captured an important
man in the gang of rustlers. It might be the
opening wedge to splitting up the gang and
freeing the entire valley of the menace which
hung over the cow country.</p>

<p>The rosy hue of the dawn faded into a slate
grey and misty clouds whirled around the
peaks of the Three Soldiers. It looked like rain,
the first in weeks.</p>

<p>Slim exclaimed bitterly, for a rain at this
time would obliterate the trail and his day of
hard riding would be without reward. Talking
almost constantly to Lightning, he pushed
the sorrel as rapidly as the rough ground would
permit. He knew that he was gaining steadily
and if the rain would only hold off another
hour, he should have his quarry.</p>

<p>The gray clouds swept lower as Slim pressed
along through the foothills, praying that the
rain would hold back a few minutes longer.
But the skies opened and the long-delayed rain
descended in torrents. The trail faded before
his eyes and Slim turned back and headed out
of the foothills. So far the rustlers held the
upper hand.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch14' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Fourteen</span><br /> <br />Powder to Burn</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Night settled over the Creeping Shadows
country on the wings of the storm and Slim still
faced a long, wet ride back to the Box B. It
was unfamiliar country, but he knew in a
general way the shortest route to the ranch
and he struck out cross-country.</p>

<p>The rain fell in torrents, and he kept to the
higher ground, working his way slowly out of
the foothills. The long-needed rain would be
worth thousands to the valley, freshening the
grass which had been burned brown by the prolonged
drought.</p>

<p>In spite of the long hours on the trail and the
hard pace of the last few hours, Lightning made
good time, and a little after ten o’clock Slim
caught sight of the lights of the ranch. The
yellow pin points of light dispelled some of the
misery of the night and disappointment of having
the trail washed out from under him.</p>

<p>The rain was cold, and in spite of the poncho,
rivulets of water ran down his neck and he became
thoroughly chilled. They struck one of
the ranch trails, and Lightning quickened her
pace. She was as anxious as Slim to get protection
from the weather.</p>

<p>The ride in from the foothills gave Slim
a chance to think over the situation in the valley.
There were certainly some unusual elements
involved.</p>

<p>First, there had been the shooting on the Sky
High trail, in which Chuck had been ambushed
and then the attempt to kill the owner
of the Box B. It was evident that things were
moving rapidly toward a climax.</p>

<p>Slim thought of his brief visit at Dirty Water
and checked over one by one the men he had
met there. The storekeeper and his clerk could
be eliminated from important roles in the
rustling gang, but Hal Titzell was a puzzling
figure. It was obvious that he had plenty of
nerve and at least an explanation for his presence
in the valley, but Slim questioned whether
he actually had been buying any cattle. That
was something he determined to find out.</p>

<p>It simply wasn’t possible for cattle to disappear
without some trace, and Slim wondered
why the Box B cowboys had been unable to find
the rendezvous of the rustlers. Then there
must be a shipping point for the stock. The
normal place was Mopstick, outside the valley,
but there might be another loading yard
nearer along the railroad that was being used.</p>

<p>As Slim mulled over the possibilities, he
realized that he and Chuck were going to be in
for some busy days before the mystery of the
rustling on the Box B could be solved.</p>

<p>Slim rode into the valley which sheltered
the headquarters of the Box B and Lightning
sloshed toward the corral. Chuck, who had
been listening for Slim’s approach, came running
with a lantern under his slicker. He
opened the gate, and horse and rider passed inside
the corral. There was a pole lean-to, with
a thatched roof, at one side of the corral and
the horses were gathered under this protection.</p>

<p>“What luck?” asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“None,” replied Slim. “I was within half
an hour of my man when the storm broke. The
trail just melted out in front of my eyes
and I turned and headed for home.”</p>

<p>“Had anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing since yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, you must be starved. Lee Wu’s kept
some food hot for you. Better get over to the
cookhouse and fill up. I’ll go up to the house
and tell Joe Haines and the boss. They’ve been
mighty anxious about you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll eat in a little bit,” said Slim, as he
pulled his saddle off Lightning. “What do you
think of the outfit here?”</p>

<p>“Everything rings true to me, except Doug
Huston. He hasn’t made a move out of the
way, but I don’t like his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. Maybe it’s unfair to Doug,
but I’m going to play a hunch and keep a
mighty close watch on him. Think the other
boys suspect we’re anything but a couple of
punchers?”</p>

<p>“No one except Joe Haines, and he knows
we’re not out here just for the fun of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not worried about Joe, but I don’t want
the others to get suspicious and I especially want
them to keep out of Dirty Water where they
might start talking.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll be too busy riding range for
anyone to get to town for a couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>“This thing will go one way or another by
that time. We’ll either have the rustlers behind
bars or they’ll have control of the valley.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p>They splashed through the mud of the corral
and made their way to the cookhouse. Lee Wu,
who had been reading, welcomed Slim.</p>

<p>“Supper hot,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m going up to the house. See you later.”
Chuck left the cookhouse and Slim was alone
with the Chinese cook.</p>

<p>Lee Wu hurried in with hot food. There
was plenty of hash, bread, and coffee and Lee
opened a can of sliced peaches.</p>

<p>“I’m just about starved,” grinned Slim, as
one mouthful of food followed another.
“Haven’t had a thing since yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“Can fix more hash,” grinned Lee Wu.</p>

<p>“No thanks. This will fill me up. Say, Wu,
you’re a real cook. I never tasted better
hash.”</p>

<p>“Not bad, not bad,” chuckled Wu. “Like
that myself.” He sat down opposite Slim and
took a generous helping of his own hash.</p>

<p>“Catch bushwhacker?” he asked.</p>

<p>Slim looked up gloomily. “No, Wu. I was
almost up with him when the rain started and
the trail was washed out. Better luck the next
time.”</p>

<p>“Tough place. Plenty boys come and work
here while and then drift on. Afraid of getting
bullet in back. No one bother Wu though.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>The cook disappeared in the kitchen to return
with a double barreled sawed-off shotgun.</p>

<p>“Fill ’em up with nails,” he chuckled. “Hit
someone and phooey!”</p>

<p>“Phooey, is right,” grinned Slim. “I guess
you’re safe enough from the rustlers. Got any
idea who’s causing all of the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Plenty ideas, no proof. Bad business to
talk with loose tongue.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Wu. A loose tongue can sure
get a fellow into a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>Chuck stuck his head in the door.</p>

<p>“They want you at the ranch house as soon
as you’re through.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be along in a minute.” Slim finished the
last of the can of peaches. “Great supper, Wu.
Thanks a lot for saving it for me.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” grinned Wu, who had warmed to
Slim’s praise of his cooking.</p>

<p>Slim found the owner of the Box B propped
up in bed. Joe Haines was in a chair nearby.</p>

<p>“Chuck’s told us about the rain,” said Adam
Marks, his keen eyes glinting beneath the bandage
which swathed his head. “Anything else
happen?”</p>

<p>Slim recounted briefly his hard ride on the
trail of the bushwhacker. “The fellow was
circling along the foothills and riding pretty
hard. He must have had an idea he would be
trailed.”</p>

<p>“You’re darned right he did,” put in the
range foreman. “We wouldn’t let a shooting
like that go without trying to get revenge.”</p>

<p>“Get any clues on the fellow’s identity?”
asked Marks.</p>

<p>“I’ll recognize the marks of his horse’s shoes
wherever I see them,” replied Slim.</p>

<p>“Good boy. We’ve needed a couple of nervy
riders like you and your pardner. It gives me
new courage. We’ll whip these rustlers to a
standstill.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how they ship the stock
they rustle,” said Slim.</p>

<p>Joe Haines smiled grimly. “I’d like to know
the same thing. I’ve got a hunch, but you
can’t prove anything on a hunch.”</p>

<p>“How do the other cattlemen in the valley
stand?”</p>

<p>“They’re all suspicious since I started losing
cattle. Claim they’re being raided, too, but
I doubt that. No one will work together. It’s
every man for himself.”</p>

<p>They discussed the situation for a time and
then Slim went to the bunkhouse. The other
riders were in their bunks, apparently asleep,
but Chuck roused up and lifted his bulk on
one elbow. He started to speak, but Slim shook
his head, undressed, turned out the light, and
rolled into the blankets. He was worn out by
the hard ride on the trail and he fell into a
slumber that was broken only by the strident
tones of Lee Wu’s breakfast bell the next morning.</p>

<p>Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Slim found
the bunkhouse deserted, but the sound of running
water and other noises informed him that
his companions were outside at the pump.</p>

<p>He slipped into his clothes and joined them.</p>

<p>“Chuck tells us the rain played you a dirty
trick,” said Walt Kelly, hitching his pants
closer about his rotund waist.</p>

<p>“It didn’t help any,” admitted Slim.</p>

<p>“Learn anything that really gives you anything
on the rustlers?” asked Doug Huston.
Slim looked into the watery eyes and thought
he detected a trace of uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” he replied. While the others
headed for the cookhouse, Slim hurried down
to the corral. He was afraid the rain had
washed the dye off Lightning, but to his intense
relief he found that the white spots were
still effectively covered.</p>

<p>There was little conversation at breakfast
as the punchers downed the stacks of cakes and
gulped the breakfast food and coffee. When
they emerged from the cookhouse, Joe Haines
was waiting for them.</p>

<p>“We’ve got two more riders,” he said, “and
we’re going to try to cover all of the main
herds everyday.” Then he assigned the work
and Slim found that he was teamed with Doug
Huston while Chuck was paired off with Pat
Beals. Joe and Walt would ride together while
Lee Wu took his faithful shotgun to the ranch
house to stand guard there.</p>

<p>Slim found Doug to be a silent riding partner,
but Doug knew the range well and they
worked west toward the foothills where he had
ridden the day before. The rain had freshened
the grass overnight and Slim marveled at the
sleek, well fed condition of the Box B cattle.
It was little wonder rustlers would take
extreme risks to get such stock as grazed on the
rolling acres of the Marks’ ranch.</p>

<p>They stopped at noon and ate the lunch Lee
Wu had prepared, then started the swing back
toward the ranch. There had been no sign of
any cattle having been stolen and the herds
were grazing calmly in the rich valleys of the
foothills.</p>

<p>They were near the north boundary of the
ranch when Slim sighted a lone rider and turned
to Doug.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the Double O boys. Nels
Anderson, their boss, keeps them all riding our
range line. Claims he’s lost cattle and doesn’t
make any bones about saying that he thinks
they’re on our range. Matter of fact, I guess
he did find about forty head he’d lost over
here.”</p>

<p>“Which doesn’t mean the Box B rustled
them.”</p>

<p>“Well you try to tell that square-head that
story. We’ve all talked ourselves hoarse.”</p>

<p>The lone horseman waved as the Box B
punchers passed a few hundred yards away
and they waved in return.</p>

<p>“That’s Al Bass. The Double O riders are
all friendly enough, but they have to do what
old Nels tells them.”</p>

<p>They reached the ranch shortly before sundown
and found the other riders there ahead of
them. There had been no sign of the rustlers
anywhere on the Box B and Joe Haines led his
punchers to supper with a lighter heart.</p>

<p>After supper Slim had a chance to talk with
the foreman alone.</p>

<p>“How many head have you lost altogether?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I’d say around 500. That’s a rough guess,
but we won’t know for sure until the fall
round-up.”</p>

<p>Slim whistled. “That’s a lot of cattle.”</p>

<p>“More than we can stand. Much more of it,
and the Box B will be ready for the auction
block.”</p>

<p>A rider appeared on the trail from Dirty
Water and they watched him approach the
ranch.</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon see a snake coming,” grunted
the foreman as he recognized the visitor as Hal
Titzell, the cattle buyer.</p>

<p>Titzell dismounted easily and faced the foreman.</p>

<p>“Been around the valley a bit today,” he said,
“and thought you might have a little choice
stuff to sell. I’ve got a special order from a
Chicago commission house. Top price for
choice beef. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Sorry Titzell, but you know we don’t do
business with you.”</p>

<p>“I thought maybe you’d changed your mind.
I heard your outfit was a little pressed for cash.”</p>

<p>“You heard wrong.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better talk with your boss,” said
the cattle buyer, starting toward the ranch
house.</p>

<p>“Adam Marks is too sick to see you,” replied
Joe, barring the way. “If I were you,
I’d start back for Dirty Water.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Titzell, apparently unperturbed
by the gruff treatment accorded
him, “but think it over. If you change your
mind about that choice stuff on your north
range, let me know.”</p>

<p>The cattle buyer mounted and rode swiftly
down the trail toward Dirty Water.</p>

<p>“I hope his horse stumbles and Titzell breaks
his neck,” snorted the range boss.</p>

<p>One remark of the cattle buyer’s lodged in
Slim’s memory. He had especially mentioned
the choice stock on the north range, which lay
next to the boundary of the Double O.</p>

<p>Slim was still feeling the fatigue of his two
arduous days on the trail of the bushwhacker
and he rolled into his blankets early, followed
shortly by the other riders of the Box B.</p>

<p>Doug and Slim rode the same section of the
range the next morning and it was well after
noon when they reached the boundary of the
Double O. On the previous day they had
passed a bunch of steers grazing in a coulee a
mile below the boundary, but the cattle were
nowhere in sight and Slim and Doug spread
out to hunt for them.</p>

<p>Slim followed their trail straight across the
line into Double O territory and he turned and
rode back to join Doug.</p>

<p>“The cattle have gone into Double O range
and it looks to me as though they were driven
there.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better get back to the ranch
and tell Joe.”</p>

<p>Slim gave Lightning her head and soon outdistanced
Doug in the ride back to the ranch.
Fortunately Joe Haines had ridden in early
and he told the foreman what had happened
on the north range.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a showdown with Nels
Anderson,” said Joe grimly. “We’re going to
get those cattle back even if we have to do it
with gunpowder!”</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch15' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Fifteen</span><br /> <br />Dangerous Hours</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“See that you’re well heeled,” admonished the
fiery foreman of the Box B as he hurried into
the bunkhouse to strap on an extra revolver.</p>

<p>Slim made sure that his saddle was well
cinched for they would be riding fast and
hard.</p>

<p>Just before they started, Walt Kelly and
Chuck rode in from the south. They were
speedily informed that Box B cattle had been
driven into Double O territory and that the
Box B was determined to have none of that.
They joined the raiding party with a whoop and
all five riders set out at full speed for the north
range, leaving a startled Lee Wu to guard the
home place and his wounded boss.</p>

<p>“How many do you think were driven onto
the Double O?” asked Joe as they galloped
northward.</p>

<p>“I’d say about forty head,” replied Slim,
“and from what I saw of them yesterday, they
were all prime beef.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the kind of cattle we’ve been
losing right along, prime stuff that knocks the
bottom out of our pocketbook. If this keeps
on much longer, we won’t have anything left
to ship this fall. I never figured old man
Anderson would stoop to rustling our stuff,
but it looks like we have the goods on him.”</p>

<p>The little cavalcade whirled northward, a
trail of dust mounting in its wake and hanging
in the still afternoon air.</p>

<p>They topped a slope and looked down on the
Double O range. A little more than a mile
away they could see a few cattle grazing.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s our stuff over there,” shouted
Walt.</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “They’d have driven
them further into their own range.”</p>

<p>They swung westward along the range line
to the place where Doug and Slim had picked
off the tracks of the missing cattle.</p>

<p>Joe swung out of the saddle and scanned
the hoofprints of the horses which had driven
the cattle into the Double O territory.</p>

<p>“Only three riders made the raid,” he
grunted. “They had plenty of nerve.”</p>

<p>Slim, looking down at the hoof prints could
hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise.
There was a distinct V-shaped nick in the left
rear shoe of one of the horses! There had been
a similar nick on the same shoe of the horse
which had carried the bushwhacker safely
away from the vengeance of the Box B.</p>

<p>Slim leaned down and spoke to Joe, and
they moved out of earshot of the others.</p>

<p>“Listen Joe, there was a V-shaped nick in the
left rear shoe of the horse I chased all over your
west range. There’s the same kind of a nick
in one of the hoofprints here.”</p>

<p>“You mean the fellow who took a shot at
the boss was one of the fellows who rustled the
cattle last night?”</p>

<p>“It looks that way.”</p>

<p>Joe’s honest eyes narrowed to steely slits and
his lips tightened into a grim line.</p>

<p>“The Double O had always been a tough outfit,
but I never figured old man Anderson
would stand for murder. If we find one of
their riders is riding a horse with a shoe like
that, watch out for trouble in great big
chunks.”</p>

<p>The Box B riders remounted and started
north into the Double O territory. From the
trail, it was evident that the cattle had been
driven hard, but the small herd had been fairly
easy to handle.</p>

<p>They penetrated more than a mile into the
Double O range when a group of riders galloped
into sight over a low hill.</p>

<p>“Here comes trouble,” grinned Chuck,
loosening his rifle and making sure that it was
ready for fast action. The other Box B riders
looked at their guns and Slim’s heart tightened.
Tempers were at a fighting pitch. It would require
some real diplomacy to get through the
next few minutes without someone being hurt,
perhaps seriously.</p>

<p>The two groups of riders swept toward each
other at a furious pace, slowing down only
when they were less than two hundred yards
apart. At a hundred yards they stopped, eyeing
each other warily, waiting for the first
break.</p>

<p>“Old man Anderson’s with his boys and he’s
wearing two guns,” said Joe. “That means
he’s on the warpath sure.”</p>

<p>Slim counted the Double O riders. Five men
were ranged behind their boss and he recognized
one of them as Al Bass, the range rider they
had seen the day before.</p>

<p>“They’ve got our cattle,” said Walt Kelly
impatiently. “What are we going to do, talk
or shoot?”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk first,” said Joe, curbing his first
impulse to shoot it out, for the Box B was outnumbered.</p>

<p>Joe held up his hand and started forward,
calling to Slim, “You ride with me and the
rest stay here and watch for any break.”</p>

<p>Nels Anderson and Al Bass rode forward
from the Double O group and they met halfway
between.</p>

<p>The owner of the Double O was a gigantic
Swede, well over six feet tall and as broad as an
ox. His huge hands rested easily on the pommel
of his saddle and the butts of his six guns
protruded from the holsters on each leg. The
light blue eyes peered out from beneath shaggy
eyebrows and his whole face was a picture of
intense rage. He burst into an immediate accusation.</p>

<p>“You fellows got nerve,” he roared. “Stealing
my cattle and then riding over here in the
daytime hunting more. By gar, this is going to
stop and stop right here!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, stealing your cattle?”
replied Joe angrily. “All we’re doing is trailing
a herd of our own stuff that you’ve driven
into your range. Fine thing for a man’s neighbor
to turn rustler.”</p>

<p>The Swede’s face flushed an angry red and
his right hand clawed at his gun, but Al Bass
reached out quickly and seized the hand with
a firm grip.</p>

<p>“Hold it, Nels,” he said. “There’s something
wrong here. I saw Box B cattle on our
range better than a mile back. They’re hunting
their stuff on our territory and we’re looking
for some of our choice beef on their side of
the line.”</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that the owner of the
Double O controlled his surging temper, and
when he spoke his voice was filled with emotion.</p>

<p>“Don’t you call me a rustler again,” he
warned Joe. “Next time maybe Al won’t be
here to stop me.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, Nels, but my temper got away from
me. We’ve been losing cattle right and left
and this time we figured we’d trailed some of
our prime beef right into your back yard.”</p>

<p>“Yeh,” grunted Al Bass. “There’s a trail a
quarter mile west of here where about sixty
head of our stuff was driven onto your range
last night. Laugh that one off.”</p>

<p>“Looks to me like a clever attempt to get the
Box B and the Double O into a lot of gun play
and clean both outfits out while they were busy
trying to settle grievances,” said Slim.</p>

<p>He turned to Nels Anderson. Briefly he told
him of the attempt to kill Adam Marks and
how he had trailed the bushwhacker, only to be
beaten back by the storm.</p>

<p>“The man who shot Adam Marks was riding
a horse that had a V-shaped mark on the left
rear shoe,” said Slim. “We found the same
mark left by one of the horses used to drive our
cattle onto your range last night.”</p>

<p>“So you figured that it was a Double O
rider who tried to kill your boss,” said Al Bass.</p>

<p>“That’s about the ticket,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Nels Anderson’s big frame shook with anger.</p>

<p>“Fools, fools,” he cried. “Why, Adam and I
came here together. We don’t always agree,
but by gar I sure wouldn’t let anyone take a
shot at him.”</p>

<p>Al Bass leaned forward.</p>

<p>“I was the fellow who found out our cattle
had been rustled and I got a good look at the
hoofprints left by the rustlers’ horses. There’s
just such a mark as you described on one of the
left rear prints.”</p>

<p>Slim smiled a little grimly.</p>

<p>“I’d kind of figured there would be. Seems
like these two outfits ought to forget any past
troubles and realize that through a clever trick
the rustlers almost had them fighting each other
to death. We figured one of your boys tried
to get our boss, and that your whole outfit
was stealing our cattle, while you fellows were
dead sure we rustled off your beef last night.”</p>

<p>Nels Anderson leaned over toward the Box
B foreman, thrusting out a huge hand.</p>

<p>“Joe, your boy is right. We have been blind.
You tell Adam that from now on we ride together.
I’ll come see him soon. Now we better
throw in together. We’ll round up your stuff
and drive it back on your range and then bring
our cattle back.”</p>

<p>They united forces and turned back into the
Double O range to hunt out the Box B cattle.
Slim felt that real progress had been made. The
differences between the Double O and the Box
B had been smoothed over and the two largest
outfits in the Creeping Shadows had united for
a stand against the rustlers. He looked over
the cowpunchers. They were a hard riding lot,
every one of them capable of a good fight and
Slim knew that the rustlers were going to be in
for some dangerous hours before many more
days passed.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch16' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Sixteen</span><br /> <br />Telltale Marks</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was sundown when the Double O and the
Box B riders finished the task of getting the
cattle back on their own ranges. They stopped
at the boundary between the ranches and the
Double O cattle plodded northward onto their
own range.</p>

<p>“How many cattle you figure you’ve lost?”
Joe asked the owner of the Double O.</p>

<p>“Right around 350,” replied Nels. “How
many have you?”</p>

<p>“It’s more than that. A good 500 head and
maybe a few more have been stolen in the last
few months. I tell you, it’s hit us mighty
hard.”</p>

<p>Nel’s pale eyes hardened and his huge hands
moved convulsively for he was a man of deep
emotion.</p>

<p>“We shall stop that, and soon,” he roared.
“Tomorrow we go see Cook and line him up.
After that we’ll clean out Dirty Water and
maybe that will stop the rustling.”</p>

<p>Joe looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ll be able to swing Cook
along with us,” he said, “and when it comes
to cleaning up Dirty Water, we’ll have to have
some proof.”</p>

<p>“I’m tired of waiting,” said Nels. “Action
I got to have. There’s no law in the valley unless
we make it ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Slim, “but let’s wait
until we’re sure of the gang responsible for
this rustling.”</p>

<p>Nels grumblingly agreed that Slim’s advice
was logical and they parted with the agreement
that the Box B foreman would ride over to the
Double O in the morning and that Nels would
accompany him on a visit to the Cook ranch.</p>

<p>“What sort of a fellow is this Cook?”</p>

<p>“All bad,” replied Joe. “He runs the Diamond
Dot, a small outfit that lies east of the
Double O and the Box B and north of Dirty
Water. His range backs right up against the
Cajons. We’ve had lots of trouble with him
over our water rights.”</p>

<p>“Has he been losing cattle the last year?”</p>

<p>“Claims he’s lost a bunch, but I wouldn’t
take his word for anything. Unless we keep
a close watch, he runs his cattle over on our
range and they clean up some of our best grazing
land.”</p>

<p>“Then it won’t be much use to see him tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, but it will satisfy Nels,
and if Cook has really been losing beef he may
throw in with us. He has a lot of riders and
they’re all tough birds. If the three outfits
made a united stand, we’d sweep this valley
clean of every undesirable hombre that’s come
in here the last couple of years.”</p>

<p>When they reached the home place, Joe went
at once to report the events of the day to the
owner of the Box B while the cowboys hurried
into the cookhouse, where Lee Wu had supper
ready.</p>

<p>“Golly, but I thought there was going to be
trouble when Joe called Nels Anderson a
rustler,” said Walt Kelly, between mouthfuls
of bread.</p>

<p>“There would have been if Al Bass hadn’t
grabbed his hand,” put in jovial Pat Beals.
“I’m telling you, my hair was standing on end.”</p>

<p>“We’re finally getting started on the right
track,” said Walt, “even if it almost took
bloodshed to get these outfits together. Believe
me, it’s going to be tough for the rustlers
from now on.”</p>

<p>Slim had been watching Doug Huston and
he thought he saw the cowboy’s face twitch
slightly. One thing, Doug had expressed no
elation at the peacemaking with the Double O.</p>

<p>There was only the faintest tinge of light
over the Three Soldiers as they left the cookhouse.
Up at the ranch house, a light glowed
in Adam Marks’ bedroom and Slim knew that
the foreman was recounting in great detail the
happenings of the day.</p>

<p>Slim walked down to the corral and whistled
softly. Out of the shadows came Lightning,
and Slim climbed up to the top rail and ran his
hands through the sorrel’s thick mane.</p>

<p>“We made a little progress today,” he said
softly and Lightning tossed her head in agreement.
“But we’ve got a long way to go,”
added Slim, and again the sorrel nodded.</p>

<p>Chuck came down from the bunkhouse and
climbed atop the corral.</p>

<p>“Doing a little heavy thinking?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Trying to, but the results are about zero.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how the 800 and some head
that have been stolen from the Box B and the
Double O were taken out of the valley,” said
Chuck.</p>

<p>“When we discover how that’s been done,
we’ll be just about at the end of this mystery.”</p>

<p>“They’ve been rustled in small lots, but even
then cattle can’t fly.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason I’m anxious to see what
kind of a place the Diamond Dot runs. Joe
Haines don’t like that outfit a bit.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t like the Double O until he realized
that somebody was trying to get the two
outfits to fighting,” pointed out Chuck.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any more trouble along that
line and I feel we’ve made a little progress, but
not enough.”</p>

<p>Slim’s fingers, exploring an inside pocket,
came in contact with the cartridge he had
found at the scene of Adam Marks’ ambush.
He had two definite clues, the exploded shell
and the V-shaped hoofprint. Somewhere in
the valley he must find the rider of that horse.</p>

<p>The cowboy detectives returned to the
bunkhouse. The foreman was still at the ranch
house and the other Box B riders were engaged
in various personal tasks.</p>

<p>Slim and Chuck rolled in early, and a few
minutes later the others were in their blankets.</p>

<p>Slim fell into a restless sleep, for even after
his body relaxed his mind was working on the
rustling mystery. Thus it was that he heard a
slight noise down at the corral and awakened almost
instantly.</p>

<p>Slim pulled on his trousers, picked up his
boots, and left the bunkhouse silently. Someone
was in the corral saddling a horse. Slim
moved swiftly forward. The moon, which had
topped the Cajons, was shrouded with clouds.</p>

<p>The cowboy detective paused beside the main
gate of the corral to see what was going on inside
and had just stuck his head above the top
rail when a rope swished out of the shadows
and settled over his head. Before he could utter
a sound, it was jerked tight and he fell sprawling
to the ground, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Slim clawed at the rope, but it was too tight.
Someone was running toward him, coming out
of the corral.</p>

<p>The moonlight brightened for an instant and
Slim looked up into a masked face.</p>

<p>“Smart guy,” came a hard, chilling voice.
“Well, you’re not as smart as you think you
are.”</p>

<p>Slim tried to dodge, but the other man struck
him with a short, heavy club, and the cowboy
detective lost consciousness. When he finally
opened his eyes, the moon was well toward its
zenith and his head throbbed dismally.</p>

<p>He tried to move, but found his arms and
feet securely bound and a tight gag in his aching
mouth. He managed to roll over and lift
his head. He had been carried a hundred yards
from the corral and deposited beside the creek.
Slim tried to wriggle along the ground, but he
made little progress and it was an exhausting
effort. He rolled over on his back and looked
up at the moon. There was nothing to do but
wait for morning.</p>

<p>It was well after midnight when Slim heard
a horse approaching the Box B. It was coming
slowly as though the rider was afraid of discovery.
Then the gate of the corral was opened
and Slim knew that his assailant had returned.
There was no question now but that one of
the Box B riders was allied with the rustlers for
Slim felt sure that the unknown rider had
slipped away to inform the other members of
the gang that the Box B and the Double O
were standing shoulder to shoulder to resist any
further depredations.</p>

<p>The aching hours went by slowly. The
moon dropped behind the Three Soldiers and
for over an hour the Creeping Shadows country
was cloaked in the deepest night. Then the
peaks of the Cajons were touched with the first
streaks of another day and Slim moved a little
to rest his tortured body.</p>

<p>It was an hour later before he was found and
then Chuck saw him lying beside the creek
and hurried to slash his bonds.</p>

<p>Slim had to be helped to a sitting position,
for the circulation had long since stopped in
his feet and hands. Chuck worked carefully,
rubbing the bruised members. Slim cried out
in pain once or twice as the blood again coursed
through the arteries and veins. His tongue was
badly swollen and Chuck ran for a cup of
water. Returning, he took a clean handkerchief
and soaked it with water. This Slim
placed in his mouth, sucking gratefully at the
cool liquid.</p>

<p>Joe Haines heard that something was wrong
and came hurrying down, the other Box B
riders following him. Slim waved aside their
questions for his jaws ached too much to talk
and it was not until he had downed a bowl of
breakfast food that he told them the full story.</p>

<p>“Have any idea who it was?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest,” replied Slim, deciding
not to reveal that he had heard the rider return
to the Box B.</p>

<p>Walt Kelly hurried down to the corral to
look at the horses.</p>

<p>“Every cayuse is there,” he said when he
returned.</p>

<p>“Then I can’t figure out what anyone was
doing in our corral,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Maybe he was going to run off with the
horses and Slim came along just in time to give
him a scare,” suggested Doug.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” agreed Joe, but it was plain
that such an explanation did not satisfy him.</p>

<p>When they left the cookhouse, Joe turned to
Slim.</p>

<p>“Feel like riding over to the Double O with
me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be all right in a few minutes. Count me
in. I want to be along when you talk with the
boss of the Diamond Dot.”</p>

<p>Slim went to the bunkhouse while the others
hastened down to the corral to get their mounts.
The cowboy detective was firmly convinced
that someone in the bunkhouse had slugged
him the night before and left him hog-tied
along the creek.</p>

<p>With quick, deft hands he searched one bunk
after another. It was not until he reached
Doug Huston’s duffel bag that he found anything.
Wadded in the bottom was a black
cloth which might easily be tied around the
lower part of the face to form a mask. Slim
nodded grimly. His suspicions that Doug was
the rustlers’ key man on the ranch were rapidly
being confirmed.</p>

<p>Slim rammed the black cloth back into the
duffel bag and slipped on his chaps, slung his
gun belt around his hips, and started for the
corral.</p>

<p>An excited group was gathered at the gate,
looking at tracks which led into the corral.</p>

<p>“Look here, Slim,” cried Chuck. “One of
the rustlers, the guy that took a shot at the boss,
rode right into our own corral last night.
Here’s his tracks going in, but there’s none coming
out.”</p>

<p>Slim looked down at the hoofprint to which
Chuck pointed. There was the telltale V-shaped
mark.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch17' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Seventeen</span><br /> <br />The Night Alarm</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There was no mistaking the V-shaped nick.
It was clearly outlined in the dust and Slim
stooped to look at it closely.</p>

<p>“Kind of looks like the mysterious rider was
the guy who roped me around the neck and
then left me down by the creek to hear the
crickets sing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Maybe he was trying to get another shot at
the boss,” said Walt Kelly.</p>

<p>“If he was, he wouldn’t have ridden right
into our corral. Anyway, there’re no marks
like this one coming out,” Chuck pointed out.</p>

<p>Slim sat back on his heels, puzzled at the
turn of events, while Chuck ambled into the
corral. A minute later he shouted for them
to join him and they hurried inside.</p>

<p>Chuck was looking at his own horse but as
they approached he pointed at the dust.</p>

<p>“My gosh, fellows, my own horse has that
V-shaped mark on his left rear shoe!”</p>

<p>“That kind of puts you in a hole,” spoke up
Doug Huston.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” retorted Slim
sharply. “Chuck wasn’t on the range when the
boss was shot and you fellows know darned
well where he was the other night when the
rustlers were chasing our cattle onto the
Double O range. This is just a trick of the
rustlers to cause suspicion in our own outfit.
The fellow who slugged me last night rode
away on Chuck’s horse and while he was away
from the ranch he had the V-shaped mark filed
in the shoe. It was clever trick, but it didn’t
work.”</p>

<p>Joe Haines, who had been strangely silent,
stepped forward.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Slim,” said the foreman.
“Putting that nick on the shoe of that cayuse
was aimed to throw us on the wrong track.
What’s troubling me is how the rustlers learned
we were after a horse with a shoe marked like
that. As far as I know only our own outfit
knew about it and Nels Anderson and Al
Bass.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think the Double O would shoot
straight,” said Doug.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t jump at conclusions,” said Slim.
“When this thing is finally cleared up there’s
going to be a lot of surprised people in the
Creeping Shadows country.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you talk like a cattle detective,”
snapped Doug.</p>

<p>“If I was a cattle detective,” replied Slim
smoothly, “I’d probably be slipping the iron
bracelets on these rustlers and starting them for
the state penitentiary.”</p>

<p>“Better get a file and smooth out that mark,”
Joe told Chuck. “There’s no use your cluttering
up the landscape with V-shaped signs.”</p>

<p>Chuck departed for the blacksmith shop and
Slim and Joe saddled and mounted their horses.</p>

<p>Joe gave the riding orders for the day to the
other punchers. Then with Slim he rode north
toward the Double O. After a time he spoke.</p>

<p>“Do you think it was someone on the ranch
who waylaid you last night and rode away on
Chuck’s horse?”</p>

<p>Slim picked his words carefully as he replied
for even though he had absolute faith in
the integrity of the foreman, he did not intend
to reveal that he was in the employ of the
Mountain States Cattlemen’s Association and
working under Old Bill Needham until the
showdown.</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to believe someone on the ranch
is tipping the rustlers off to every move.
That’s the only way the gang could have
learned the boss was carrying money with him
the night they shot him and it’s the only way
they could have learned about the nick in the
horseshoe. Whoever is doing the thinking for
this gang is clever and dangerous.”</p>

<p>“He’s all of that, but he’ll never match the
power of the cattlemen if we line up Hack
Cook.”</p>

<p>Nels Anderson and Al Bass were waiting for
them and they swung into their saddles as the
Box B men approached.</p>

<p>“Anything happen last night?” asked Nels.
Slim related what had occurred at the Box B
corral.</p>

<p>“That’s no good,” he said. “It means
there’s a traitor in your outfit.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that until we’ve got the proof,”
Joe warned him, for although he was privately
convinced that Nels was right, he wasn’t going
to let any outsider cast any reflections on his
riders until he had ample proof.</p>

<p>With Nels and Joe ahead, they rode toward
the Diamond Dot. Slim found Al Bass a
pleasant companion and they discussed the
range war at length.</p>

<p>“Your outfit’s pretty well loaded with men,”
Slim said.</p>

<p>“The Box B would be if they could keep
their hands on,” grinned Al, “but after those
two cattle detectives were killed and a couple
of the other boys got winged, a bunch of them
blew out of the country.”</p>

<p>“The present outfit won’t blow,” said Slim.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. I wouldn’t count
too much on Doug Huston. He looks like a
weak sister to me.”</p>

<p>It was nearly noon when they reached the
Diamond Dot, which lay north and well to the
east of the Box B although almost directly east
of the Double O.</p>

<p>Water on the Diamond Dot was not as
plentiful as on the neighboring ranches and the
grass was thinner. The buildings, almost under
the Cajons, were in a poor state of repair and
the corral was a ramshackled affair. Two cowboys
in front of the bunkhouse looked up as
the riders approached and four more men appeared
to watch the visitors. On the porch of
the ranch house a man pulled himself out of an
old rocking chair. He was in his stocking feet
and had been dozing and smoking his pipe at
intervals.</p>

<p>“That’s Hack Cook on the porch,” said Al.
“He’s a tough customer and I’ve got a hunch
we won’t get any cooperation from him.”</p>

<p>Slim looked at the owner of the Diamond
Dot. Hack Cook was almost square. His
shoulders were tremendously broad and his
chest was like a barrel. His face was red and
his neck so short that it disappeared into his
body.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hack,” rumbled Nels as the riders
stopped in front of the porch.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” replied Hack, but he gave no
hint that he intended to ask them to dismount
and have dinner at the ranch. “What’s on your
mind?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” said Nels. “It’s about the rustlers.
The Double O and the Box B are joining
forces.”</p>

<p>Hack’s face reddened and his voice trembled.
“Joining forces? It’s about time you big outfits
did that. Now you’ll try to ruin me altogether.
You haven’t been able to do it singly
so you’re doubling up on me. Well, I’m serving
notice on you right now that I’ve got fighting
men on my payroll and we’re going to fight
to the end.”</p>

<p>“Why you crazy fool,” broke in Joe Haines,
“we’re not looking for trouble. We’re offering
you a chance to join us and run the rustlers
out of the valley. You claim you’ve been losing
stock. Here’s your chance to prove it by
throwing in with us. We’re going to give this
valley the once-over with a fine-toothed
comb.”</p>

<p>Slim had been making a survey of the Diamond
Dot layout. He was surprised at the
number of cowboys at the bunkhouse. There
were six outside, more than the Box B carried
and as many as the Double O, which were much
larger ranches than the Diamond Dot.</p>

<p>There was the movement of a faded curtain
at a window on the second floor of the ranch
house and Slim started involuntarily as he got
a glimpse of the face peering out from behind
the curtain. It was that of Hal Titzell, the
cattle buyer from Dirty Water. It was true
that Titzell had visited the Box B two days before,
and it was possible that he was trying to
buy cattle from the Diamond Dot, but Slim
didn’t like the looks of the thing as he recalled
the early warning Doc Baldridge had given
him about Titzell.</p>

<p>Nels and Joe argued for some time with
Hack Cook, but the owner of the Diamond Dot
was adamant and no amount of cajoling on
the part of the visiting cattlemen could make
him change his mind.</p>

<p>“Then go it alone,” exploded Nels at last,
“and I hope to heaven you lose every one of
your cattle, that your grass burns up and your
water holes go dry.”</p>

<p>“They probably will if you can do anything
about it,” retorted Hack.</p>

<p>The visitors whirled their horses about and
departed at a gallop.</p>

<p>“What burns me up is that he didn’t ask us
to eat,” grumbled Al Bass. “Our cook quit
last night and one of the boys had to rustle grub
this morning. We fed light.”</p>

<p>Slim could sympathize with Al, for even
though he had enjoyed one of Lee Wu’s good
breakfasts, he was hungry. When they reached
the Double O, the Box B riders paused only
long enough to water their horses, before pressing
on toward the home ranch.</p>

<p>Nels and Joe had decided on night riding and
Slim knew that there would be little rest for
him until after the dawn of another day.
When they returned to the ranch, Joe explained
the new plan of action.</p>

<p>“We’re splitting up the range,” he said.
“Most of the stuff has been stolen along our
north and east line and along the south and
east line of the Double O. We’ll load up a
chuck wagon at once and start for our north
line where we’ll make camp. Get a move on,
boys, and help Lee Wu get ready. The Double
O’s lost their cook and Lee’s got to cook for
both outfits.”</p>

<p>It was just before sunset when a team was
hitched to the chuck wagon and Wu, his shotgun
over his knees, cracked the whip, yelled a
wild Chinese chant, and the team leaped away
to the accompaniment of many crashing pots
and pans.</p>

<p>Walt Kelly, in spite of his protests, was left
at the ranch to guard the boss and to feed and
care for him while the others trailed out behind
the fast-wheeling Wu.</p>

<p>It was deep twilight when they reached the
site which had been selected for the camp.
There was a good spring and plenty of timber.
The Double O boys were waiting and they
greeted Wu with wild shouts of joy for the
Chinaman’s reputation as a cook was known
the length and breadth of the valley.</p>

<p>It was well after dark before supper was
ready and they fell to with ravenous appetites.
The Double O riders were loud in their praises
of Wu’s cooking and the grinning Chinaman
served them again and again until he finally
spread his hands and said, “All gone, too much
hungry.”</p>

<p>They grinned and leaned back on the
ground, waiting for orders from Nels and Joe.
Slim looked them over. In addition to the
Double O boss and Al Bass, there were five
riders from that ranch. All of them were
clean, capable-appearing fellows. In the Box
B contingent were Joe, Doug, Pat Beals, Chuck
and himself. With Wu to guard the camp, that
meant twelve riders were available for riding
the range.</p>

<p>Nels, by virtue of his years, took command
and assigned each rider to his night’s work.
Three shots, fired in rapid succession, were to
be the signal that trouble was ahead.</p>

<p>“This is a finish fight,” Nels warned them.
“The word’s gone out that we mean business.
Shoot first and ask questions afterward.”</p>

<p>The riders scattered to their horses and a
few minutes later were stringing along the east
range of the Double O and the Box B. East of
them lay the Diamond Dot. Slim and Chuck
rode south together. They were to patrol near
the trail which led from the Box B to Dirty
Water.</p>

<p>“Think we’ll get anything by this night riding?”
asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“We may not get anything, but neither will
the rustlers,” replied Slim. “I’ve got a hunch
that the key to the whole mystery is somewhere
around the Diamond Dot. I saw Hal Titzell
there this afternoon. He was watching us
from a second story window.”</p>

<p>“You mean that the Diamond Dot is rustling
the stuff from the Double O and the Box B and
then Titzell steps in and buys the cattle?”
asked Chuck.</p>

<p>“It might be something like that,” admitted
Slim, “but I’m not going to advance too many
theories. We’ve got to be careful they don’t
spot us as cattle detectives.”</p>

<p>They parted near the trail to Dirty Water,
Chuck riding further south along the east line
of the Box B.</p>

<p>Midnight passed, and up and down the long
line of riders there was nothing reported out
of the way. Pat Beals was on one side of Slim
and Chuck on the other. He contacted them
at intervals and they talked briefly before starting
the return ride down their section of the
line. It was lonely work, riding the range
at night, with the feeling that rustlers might be
encountered at any minute. Slim fingered the
six gun at his side and made sure that it was
free in the holster. Then he slipped his rifle
in and out of the scabbard to satisfy himself
that it was ready for instant action.</p>

<p>The thin moonlight faded and the night became
doubly black. Another hour and the sky
over the Cajons would brighten, but in the interval
before that Slim had the feeling that
many things might happen.</p>

<p>He was riding north when trouble started.
Behind him and from Chuck’s section of the
range came three shots, one after another.
Slim wheeled and listened. There was a sharp,
terrible fusillade. Then silence.</p>

<p>Whipping his own gun from his holster he
fired three times in the air and urged Lightning
into a mad gallop. From behind him he could
hear the alarm signal echoing up the line as other
riders repeated the warning shots and he knew
that they were pounding along in his wake.
The rustlers were riding somewhere before him
and he knew they had already silenced Chuck’s
guns. With black anger in his heart, he leaned
over Lightning and urged the great sorrel to
even greater speed.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch18' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Eighteen</span><br /> <br />On A New Trail</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim and Lightning sped through the darkness
at a mad, headlong pace that fairly devoured
distance. They passed the end of Slim’s patrol
and entered Chuck’s territory.</p>

<p>Slim pulled the sorrel up short and listened.
From far behind him came the pounding of
hoofs, the other Box B and Double O riders
coming to the alarm but ahead of him there
was only a dismal silence. The sound of gun
shots had long since died away and Slim progressed
more slowly.</p>

<p>There was a chance that he might walk into
a trap, but an even greater chance that if he
hurried he might pass Chuck in the dark.</p>

<p>It was nerve wracking to hold Lightning
down to a walk, but Slim kept up the steady
pace as the sound of the riders behind him came
nearer.</p>

<p>Pat Beals was the first to catch him.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Slim. “I heard
Chuck give the alarm and then there was a volley
of shots. I haven’t heard a thing since then
and haven’t been able to find Chuck.”</p>

<p>Other riders joined them and they spread out
to hunt for the missing cowboy. The sky was
graying before they found the first clue. Joe
Haines stumbled on the trail. His gun blazed
three quick shots into the sky and they rallied
to him at a gallop.</p>

<p>Joe pointed to a broad trail before him.</p>

<p>“There goes one of our choice bunches of
beef,” he said bitterly. “That means Chuck
stumbled on the rustlers on our range.”</p>

<p>“Comb this section again,” roared Nels
angrily. “Maybe they left Chuck wounded
some place just out of our sight. Get him first,
then the cattle.”</p>

<p>Again the riders, grimly silent, spread out
and through the early hours of the morning
they rode in search of the missing Box B
puncher. It was mid forenoon before they
gathered around the chuck wagon, weary and
hungry from the all-night vigil and the search.</p>

<p>Squatting on their heels, with pans of piping
hot food before them, they listened as Joe
Haines outlined the next step in their campaign
against the rustlers.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty evident that the rustlers captured
Chuck and forced him to go with them,”
he said. “The thing to do now is to go after
the cattle. The trail’s fresh and even though
they’ve a few hours start, we’ll be able to overtake
them.”</p>

<p>“That trail’s heading for the Diamond Dot,”
said Nels harshly.</p>

<p>“I know it. Look to your guns, boys.
There’ll be trouble before the day’s over. If
any of you want to pull out now, that’s all right
with us.”</p>

<p>No man moved as though to leave and after
the hearty breakfast, each one examined his
guns.</p>

<p>With Nels and Joe in the lead, they swung
into their saddles. It was an earnest, silent
group of riders that trotted south along the
Box B line to pick up the trail of the missing
cattle. They found the trail and turned east
into Diamond Dot territory, with the rugged
foothills of the Cajons only a few miles ahead
of them.</p>

<p>Al Bass leaned over and spoke to Slim.</p>

<p>“Once the rustlers get the cattle to the Cajons,
it will be tough finding them. They’ll
break up the herd and we’ll have to comb every
valley.”</p>

<p>Slim nodded and gave voice to his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we likely to run into the Diamond
Dot, going through their range this way?”</p>

<p>“I’m kind of hoping we will,” shot back Al.
“My own hunch is that the Diamond Dot is in
thick with the rustlers. If they aren’t actually
doing the rustling, they know who it is. Why,
the Box B or the Double O would never let
rustlers drive a herd across their range.”</p>

<p>It was shortly after noon and they were well
into the Diamond Dot country when Slim,
who was now in the lead, sighted a cloud of
dust coming toward them. A few minutes
later a plodding herd of cattle was visible and
behind it was ranged a cordon of riders.</p>

<p>The Box B and Double O punchers paused
to survey the scene. Then Joe exploded.</p>

<p>“What nerve!” he roared. “Those are Box
B cattle and that’s a Diamond Dot gang riding
behind them.”</p>

<p>His hands flashed to his side and his gun
leaped up, ready for instant action, but Nels
reached out a huge hand and restrained him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Joe. They’re driving the
cattle toward your range. Hold your temper
and we’ll see what’s up.”</p>

<p>A lone rider broke away from the group behind
the cattle and galloped toward the visitors.
Slim recognized the powerful, squat figure of
Hack Cook, owner of the Diamond Dot.</p>

<p>Cook pulled up sharp and his horse reared
as he jerked savagely on the bit.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of invading my range?”
asked Cook angrily, his heavy face flushing.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of driving our cattle
around on your range?” countered Joe.</p>

<p>“We’re bringing them home. Found them
here a couple of hours ago and started back with
them. I don’t want those scrubs eating up my
grass.”</p>

<p>“So you found them?” drawled Nels, his
light blue eyes little more than slits under his
shaggy brows. “Well, mister, let me tell you,
those cattle were rustled last night off the Box
B’s east line and one of their riders is missing.
Someone’s going to have a lot of explaining
to do.”</p>

<p>“I’m not explaining anything,” replied
Cook. “We found the cattle this morning.
Go get ’em and take them home.”</p>

<p>“Your horse looks about worn out, Hack,”
put in Joe. “Must have been doing a lot of
night riding.”</p>

<p>“We don’t ride our range at night,” replied
the Diamond Dot boss.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, your horse is about worn
out. Better get another or this nag may collapse
and you’d have to walk home, which
would be just too bad.”</p>

<p>Cook growled something under his breath,
but wheeled and galloped back to join his own
riders. They soon drew away from the Box B
cattle, heading back for their ranch house.</p>

<p>The Box B and Double O riders circled the
herd and started it again on the journey back
to the home range.</p>

<p>Joe scanned the cattle with practiced eye.</p>

<p>“Holy mackerel,” he exclaimed. “We’ve
been gyped right. There should be at least 250
head in this bunch and I can’t count more than
185 or 188.”</p>

<p>Slim and Nels checked the number in the
herd. Joe was right. At most there were not
more than 190 in the herd.</p>

<p>“Which means the rustlers skimmed the
cream of the herd and turned the rest back.
It would be too easy to trail a bunch this size.
Also, turning them back allays our suspicions,”
said Joe.</p>

<p>“Darned if I don’t think it was the Diamond
Dot that rustled the stuff last night, took what
they wanted, and started back with the rest
when they figured we’d be on the trail,” said
Al Bass.</p>

<p>“I think you’re right,” agreed Slim. “I
want to know what’s happened to Chuck.”</p>

<p>Nels looked at the Cajons with a critical eye.
“I expect the answer’s some place in the mountains,
but it would take weeks to comb them
and we can’t leave our own range unprotected
that long. We’ll just have to play along and
hope that we can get the rustlers and find your
friend at the same time.”</p>

<p>But Slim was sick at heart for he knew what
had happened to the other cattle detectives sent
into the Creeping Shadows country. They had
disappeared, never to be heard from again and
he was afraid that a similar fate had befallen
Chuck.</p>

<p>They herded the cattle back to the Box B
range and then Slim drew Joe to one side.</p>

<p>“I’m riding alone for a while,” he said. “If I
get the breaks, I’ll turn up some valuable clues
on the rustlers and also find Chuck.”</p>

<p>“Good luck, boy,” said Joe.</p>

<p>Slim turned away from the other riders and
headed straight back into the Diamond Dot
range. There was at least three hours of daylight
left and he soon reached the place where
they had met the Diamond Dot riders. Slim
pressed on along the trail of the cattle, following
it into the first of the Cajon foothills.</p>

<p>There he saw that the cattle, driven at a hard
pace after being taken from the Box B range,
had been watered and the bulk of the herd
turned back toward their home range. It was
evident that the rest of the cattle had been
driven in small groups into the foothills. This,
in itself, did not interest Slim greatly, for he
had been convinced of what had happened.
He was seeking a clue that would lead him to
the hideout where he hoped he would find
Chuck.</p>

<p>Half a dozen trails led away from the water
hole and Slim finally decided on one which led
toward the heart of the Cajons. It was sound
reasoning that the hideout of the rustlers would
be in some mountain fastness.</p>

<p>Slim followed the trail cautiously, wary lest
he ride into a trap. The trail branched in several
places, but Slim pressed deeper into the
mountain country, climbing higher and
higher.</p>

<p>The trail was well worn and he knew that it
had been used recently so he kept on. To his
surprise, it followed a low pass through the
mountains and it was mid evening when he
reached the summit.</p>

<p>Behind him spread the Creeping Shadows
country while to the east and north the moon
was coming over the horizon. Far away he
saw the flash of a locomotive headlight and he
determined on a new course of action. Undoubtedly
this trail, unknown to anyone on the
Box B or the Double O as far as he knew, led
down to the railroad, perhaps even to Mopstick,
the shipping point for cattle from the
Creeping Shadows country.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch19' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Nineteen</span><br /> <br />More Clues</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim rode for another hour and then, with the
moonlight bright, found a suitable camping
place away from the trail. He tethered Lightning
and unrolled his own blanket. In spite of
his worry over Chuck’s disappearance, he was
soon asleep, worn out by the previous night ride
and the long day in the saddle.</p>

<p>He was up with the dawn and a few minutes
later, astride Lightning, was going down the
trail. It was nearly mid morning when he
reached the railroad and turned to his left to
follow the line to the cattle shipping point.</p>

<p>A locomotive hooted a few minutes later and
Slim moved away from the track as a transcontinental
limited roared by. Passengers on the
rear platform waved to the lone rider and Slim
returned the greeting. Far down the rails he
could see the cluster of buildings that was Mopstick,
but the limited shot by without stopping.</p>

<p>Mopstick consisted of a water tank, a blistered
station, three boxcars which had been set
on the ground for the families of the section
men, and the stockyards. There was no store.</p>

<p>Slim tied Lightning in the shadow of the
water tank where a trough overflowed with
cool water. Entering the depot, he found the
operator busy copying orders for a freight that
was wheezing along in the wake of the limited.</p>

<p>Slim had reached the point where he needed
information and needed it in a hurry. When
the agent turned around he produced the small
badge of authority from the governor and
found that it opened, as though by magic, the
way to obtain the facts he sought.</p>

<p>“I want to see your records on cattle shipments
in the last year,” said Slim.</p>

<p>Without protest, the agent produced the
large book with carbons of the bills of lading.
The Diamond Dot, the smallest outfit in the
north end of the Creeping Shadows, had
shipped as many cattle as the Double O and the
Box B combined.</p>

<p>“The Diamond Dot is a pretty good customer
of this railroad,” said Slim.</p>

<p>“Just about the best we’ve got around here.
They’ve been shipping a lot more stuff in the
last year than ever before.”</p>

<p>“Ever hear anything about any rustling
going on in the Creeping Shadows country?”
asked Slim, watching the agent intently.</p>

<p>“Sure. There’s been bad talk for a couple
of years, but nothing seems to come of it. Lots
of people think the Box B and the Double O
are getting ready to grab the Diamond Dot.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“Why I’ve heard Hack Cook of the Diamond
Dot tell how the big outfits were trying
to run over him.”</p>

<p>“Then doesn’t it seem kinda queer that
Cook’s shipping as many cattle as the other two
combined?”</p>

<p>“I asked him about that once,” replied the
railroad man, “and he said he was cleaning out
his range so if they chased him out he wouldn’t
lose so much.”</p>

<p>Slim grunted. It was an explanation, but a
pretty thin one. He went out to the yards.
They had not been used for some weeks, but he
recalled that the last bill of lading had been
dated only the week before. He turned back
to the station.</p>

<p>“Your last bill of lading was dated only a
week ago,” he told the agent, “but those yards
haven’t been used for at least a month. Something
funny’s going on around here. You’d
better talk and talk fast.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say the cattle had been shipped
from here,” replied the agent. “You didn’t
ask me where they were shipped from. Just
keep your temper and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>The freight whistled in, stopping only long
enough for water and orders, and then clanked
out again. When he had reported the passage
of the freight, the agent turned to Slim.</p>

<p>“Cook drives his cattle through a low pass
in the Cajons and hits the main line about
fifteen miles below here. In order to save time
we load direct on a way freight, using a portable
chute.”</p>

<p>“Then Cook lets you know a couple of days
in advance so you can have the chute on the
way freight?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I have to see that the freight’s carrying
enough empty cattle cars to take care of
his stuff. He’s shipping two cars out tomorrow
night.”</p>

<p>“You’re certain about that?”</p>

<p>The agent handed Slim a copy of an order
he had sent the dispatcher, asking for two
empty cattle cars in the way freight the next
night.</p>

<p>Slim tossed the order back.</p>

<p>“Keep your mouth shut about my visit. If
a word leaks out that I’ve been here, I’ll know
who’s to blame and I’ll see that you get in
plenty of trouble.”</p>

<p>He hurried out of the station, his mind buzzing
with plans. Cook was shipping cattle the
next night fifteen miles down the line. It was
time for action. There wasn’t a minute to lose.
Hours of hard riding faced him, but he felt
that within the next two days the mystery of
the rustling in the Creeping Shadows country
would be solved.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch20' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty</span><br /> <br />The Cloudburst</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was on the ride back to the line camp of the
Double O and the Box B that Lightning showed
her magnificent stamina. Mile after mile the
big sorrel covered at a trail-eating lope.</p>

<p>Slim didn’t dare return to the Creeping
Shadows country through the low pass. Instead,
he rode miles out of his way and came in
further north, cutting across a corner of the
Diamond Dot range and then racing along the
east line of the Double O.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when threatening
clouds rolled out of the Three Soldiers in the
west. The air grew still and moist. Nature
seemed to hush as the angry clouds climbed
higher. The sun was blotted out. It was one
of those quick, terrible storms of midsummer
and Slim looked for shelter. There was none.
He could only ride, hoping that the rain would
not come down too hard.</p>

<p>The first big drops pelted him. Then the
skies opened, a gray wall of water rushing
down from the heavens. In spite of the
poncho, Slim was soon soaked and the water
rushed off Lightning’s flanks in torrents.
Heads down, horse and rider plodded on.</p>

<p>It was impossible to see more than a few hundred
feet, but Slim knew he was in a valley.
That was bad. The rain was of almost cloudburst
proportions and a wall of water might
come sweeping along at any moment.</p>

<p>Slim urged Lightning to a faster pace, and
the faithful sorrel responded. The cowboy
looked for higher ground, but instead they
seemed to be going down a gentle slope. Then
they looked down on what had been a dry
wash. It was running several feet deep with
water and rising all the time. On the other
side lay higher ground and as Slim debated
what to do, the dull rumble of oncoming water
could be heard above the noise of the storm.</p>

<p>If he turned back, it might be hours before
he could cross the stream. He leaned over and
spoke to Lightning. “Let’s go,” he urged her
and the sorrel started down the bank. Slim
almost held his breath as the water swirled
about them. Lightning walked carefully, for
a slip would send them both into the torrent.</p>

<p>The sound of the oncoming water filled the
heavens with its terrible roar and Slim looked
upstream. Around a bend poured a wall of
water, black, raging, death-dealing.</p>

<p>Lightning’s hoofs touched the other bank
and with a great leap the sorrel left the water.
But danger still lurked for horse and rider.
The wall of water was spreading out. They
were far from safety.</p>

<p>As though sensing that death was riding
hard behind them, Lightning shot ahead, mud
flying from her hoofs. In great leaps the sorrel
kept ahead of the madly rushing waters,
angling always toward the higher ground.</p>

<p>Slim looked behind. The water was gaining.
He urged Lightning to another burst of
speed and the great horse responded. It didn’t
seem possible that they would escape, but with
a last noble effort, Lightning flashed over the
muddy ground and they reached safety just as
the flood waters swept by.</p>

<p>Slim pulled up his horse and watched the
torrent roar down the valley. Gratefully he
leaned over and stoked Lightning’s head.</p>

<p>“That’s another score in your favor, girl,”
he said. “Maybe I’ll be able to repay you some
day.”</p>

<p>Almost as suddenly as it had descended the
storm broke and the sky cleared. The sun went
down behind the Three Soldiers in a crimson
aura of light and Slim and Lightning pressed
on over ground that had hardly been dampened
by the rain. They reached the line camp just
at dusk and found the Double O and Box B
riders getting ready for the night patrol. Slim
swung out of the saddle as Joe and Nels hurried
toward him.</p>

<p>“What luck?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” replied Slim, “but first I’ve got to
take care of Lightning and then get a little grub
for myself. I’m starved.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, with a plate of steaming
food before him and the Double O and Box B
riders grouped around, he related the events of
the last few hours.</p>

<p>“I’ve suspected Hack Cook for some time,”
said Joe Haines, hitching his gun belt higher
when Slim told them that another shipment of
stolen cattle was to be dispatched the next
night.</p>

<p>“They’ve shipped the last of <em>our</em> cattle,”
rumbled Nels, his hands shaking with rage.
The other cowboys backed up his remarks with
determined expressions.</p>

<p>“What’s the plan of action?” Joe asked Slim,
for the young rider, by his resourcefulness, had
become the acknowledged leader now in planning
the campaign against the rustlers.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better hit the trail for Mopstick.
Then swing south along the railroad
and lay a trap for the rustlers. They’ll drive
the cattle through the low pass in the Cajons
and we’ll catch them red-handed. That will
give us all of the evidence we’ll need.”</p>

<p>Nels nodded his approval and Joe looked
around at the others.</p>

<p>“You boys all set for a clash with the
rustlers?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You know it,” replied Al Bass.</p>

<p>Less than an hour later, the Box B and the
Double O cowboys left the line camp, Slim taking
the lead and Nels and Joe trailing close
behind. At the pace they planned to travel, it
would be an all night ride to Mopstick, where
they would water their horses, rest, and then
ride leisurely down the railroad and lay their
trap for the rustlers.</p>

<p>They crossed the country where Slim had
almost been trapped by the cloudburst and
found the stream nearly back to normal.
Hour after hour they moved along the trail,
cutting through the foothills and then over
the Cajons and down the other side.</p>

<p>Slim was thinking of the action that would
come the next night, considering first one plan
and then another for cornering the rustlers.
He didn’t want bloodshed if it could be
avoided. If things went well, the rustling in
the Creeping Shadows country would be
broken soon.</p>

<p>It was nearly dawn when they reached Mopstick,
where they watered their horses at the
trough under the railroad tank. A fast mail
thundered through the hamlet, and Al Bass
was taken for a ride by his cayuse, which went
wild at the sound of the locomotive whistle.</p>

<p>Pat Beals and one of the Double O riders had
brought along the grub and they all lent a hand
in getting breakfast. After that the horses
were turned into the stockyard and fed while
their riders slept in the cool shade of the water
tank. It was noon before they were ready to
start down the railroad.</p>

<p>Slim went into the tiny depot and spoke to
the agent.</p>

<p>“What time will the freight be along to pick
up the cattle?” he asked.</p>

<p>“About six o’clock. That gives them better
than an hour to get the beef loaded.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Slim. “Mind you now, not
a word about this to anyone.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later an even dozen grim-faced
cowboys started down the railroad, their
horses refreshed by the feed and rest and the
riders alert and ready for whatever blazing action
the next few hours might hold for them.</p>

<p>The agent had given Slim explicit directions
on just where the freight would stop and how
the cattle were loaded. It was midafternoon
when the cowboys reached the place along the
right-of-way. Fortunately there was plenty
of cover nearby, low undergrowth providing
an excellent hiding place for riflemen while an
outcropping of rock would shelter the horses
from the rustlers.</p>

<p>Slim, Joe and Nels surveyed the scene carefully.
There must be no slips. The trap must
be carefully laid.</p>

<p>It was finally decided to place riflemen in the
underbrush, holding several riders in reserve
behind the rock outcrop. The minute the firing
started, they would sweep out and cut off
the escape. With the train blocking the railroad,
the riflemen on each side and a mounted
rear guard, there seemed little chance that the
cattle thieves would be able to get away.</p>

<p>Nels took charge of the riflemen while Slim
and Joe elected to ride with the men who would
cut off the escape from the rear. By the time
they had taken their places, a cloud of dust
could be seen on the trail from the Cajons.
The rustlers were coming, driving the stolen
cattle leisurely, for there was ample time before
the freight arrived.</p>

<p>A small stream ran a half mile back from the
right-of-way and it was here that the rustlers
paused to water the cattle. Slim, watching
from the protection of the rock outcropping,
counted six riders.</p>

<p>The sound of an engine whistle came to
them faintly and he turned to see a plume of
smoke far up the track. The local freight was
coming. The rustlers heard the whistle and
started the cattle moving toward the tracks.
The showdown was near and Slim felt cool and
ready for anything that might happen.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch21' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-One</span><br /> <br />Trapped</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The freight train clanked to a stop while a
quarter of a mile away the cattle churned restlessly.
Slim was impatient for the break that
would mean action, the break that he hoped
would mean the end of the rustlers in the
Creeping Shadows country.</p>

<p>While the train crew unloaded the portable
chute, the rustlers drove the cattle nearer.
Slim looked around at the riders grouped nearby.
Impatiently Joe was fingering his six gun
and behind him Al Bass sat calmly, his face
tense and a little white. Three other horsemen
were ready to sweep out and cut off the escape
of the rustlers.</p>

<p>Watching the approach of the cattle and the
riders, Slim was not surprised to recognize the
squat, heavy form of Hack Cook, owner of the
Diamond Dot.</p>

<p>“I’m taking Cook,” muttered Joe, who recognized
the Diamond Dot owner just as Slim
did. The cowboy detective nodded. He’d let
Joe have the first chance, for after all it was a
feud between the ranches of the valley. If Joe
failed to get Cook, Slim knew that with Lightning
under him he could overtake anything in
the country.</p>

<p>The rustlers whirled around the cattle, keeping
them in a compact mass as they neared the
train. Suddenly there was a burst of gunfire.
The riflemen hidden in the bushes had blazed
away.</p>

<p>A horse and rider went down. In another
blast of lead a second rustler threw up his hand
and pitched from the saddle to lie inert upon
the ground.</p>

<p>Guns leaped into the hands of the remaining
rustlers and they opened a rapid fire on the riflemen.
Joe spurred his horse, and the riders
swept out from behind the rock. Slim was riding
easily, cautiously, ready to take the trail of
the first rustler who made a break for liberty.</p>

<p>“Get ’em all,” shouted Joe. “It’s the Diamond
Dot outfit.”</p>

<p>The gunfire was savage, ripping the silence
and hurling echoes against the boxcars. The
astonished train crew scurried for shelter.</p>

<p>The rustlers knew they were up against tremendous
odds, for the cattlemen far outnumbered
them and were shooting from shelter.</p>

<p>Hack Cook whirled to meet the menace of
the riders. He was using two guns, both of
them spouting flame and smoke. A Double O
rider who had leaped ahead of Slim slumped in
his saddle and his fright-crazed horse pitched
him to the ground.</p>

<p>Another Diamond Dot rider went down before
the hail of lead. There were only three
rustlers left, Hack Cook, one of his cowboys
and Newt Bemis, whom Slim knew as a henchman
of Hal Titzell’s.</p>

<p>Slim saw Bemis shooting at Joe. He
opened fire with his own six gun and the second
shot sent Bemis tumbling out of his saddle.</p>

<p>The remaining Diamond Dot cowboy made
a dash for the train while Hack Cook whirled
his cayuse and rode straight toward Al Bass.
Al didn’t flinch, his own gun blazing away
steadily at the two-gun desperado. But Al
never had a chance. Cook’s heavy bullet
caught him in the shoulder and he spun to the
ground.</p>

<p>Slim had been too far away to get a draw on
Cook, and the rustler broke through the cordon
of riders and dashed away up the trail leading
through the Cajons.</p>

<p>The cowboy detective paused only long
enough to make sure that the other rustler
would be captured. Then he spoke to Lightning
and set out in pursuit of Cook.</p>

<p>The great sorrel could have overtaken the
Diamond Dot owner within a mile, but Slim
had other plans. There was a fair chance that
Cook, ridden by fear, would lead him to the
mountain hideout of the rustlers and there Slim
felt that he would find Chuck. He didn’t dare
think that anything had happened to Chuck,
that he wouldn’t find his companion alive.</p>

<p>Lightning struck an easy pace, keeping
within sight of the fleeing Cook, and Slim carefully
reloaded his gun. Behind him the sound
of firing died out and he knew that the last
Diamond Dot cowboy had either been brought
down by the blazing guns of the cowboys or
had surrendered.</p>

<p>Slim looked down at the trail ahead and
something in one of the hoofprints made him
pull Lightning to a sudden halt. He slid out
of his saddle. The left rear hoofprint of
Cook’s horse was marked by a V-shaped nick.
There was no doubting it now. Cook was the
man who had ambushed the owner of the Box
B. He was the rider who had directed the raids
on the Box B and the Double O in an attempt
to get those outfits fighting each other in a finish
battle.</p>

<p>When Slim remounted, he rode with new determination.
The rustling mystery was near its
solution.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch22' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-Two</span><br /> <br />In the Cajons</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Chuck’s mind was vague and his head
throbbed dully. The last thing he could remember
was firing wildly at guns flashing in
the night. Gradually his memory returned
and he remembered the night raid by the
rustlers on the Box B cattle.</p>

<p>The riders had come silently out of the night,
following a little draw driving a small herd
ahead of them. He had swept down on them
after giving the alarm and they had opened fire
instantly. Then something had struck his
head, constellations had danced before his glazing
eyes, and he had collapsed in the saddle.
How much time had elapsed or where he was,
were questions he couldn’t answer.</p>

<p>Chuck moved cautiously and learned that
he was bound hand and foot. His roving eyes
took in his prison. He was lying on the floor
of a lean-to, one wall of which was formed by
a larger cabin. It was daylight, for he could
see the sky through cracks in the roof, but there
was no sound to indicate that anyone was near.</p>

<p>The cowboy detective attempted to sit up,
and after a painful ordeal, managed to twist
his body into a partially upright position. His
hands and feet were numb, but there was a
little give in the ropes which held his hands and
he moved them steadily. The circulation returned
to his aching arms. For a time Chuck
had hopes of freeing his hands, but he had to
give up in defeat and he rolled back onto the
floor.</p>

<p>Hours passed before he heard the sound of
horses and a few minutes later two riders dismounted
within a few feet of the lean-to. He
could hear their voices plainly. One he recognized
as that of Hack Cook and the other,
though familiar, he could not identify.</p>

<p>“Where’s the kid?” he heard the unknown
ask.</p>

<p>“Tied up on the floor of the lean-to. He’s
got a back nick in his head where one of our
bullets grazed him last night.”</p>

<p>Well, that was something. Chuck knew
that the raid had taken place only the night
before and from the waning sunlight, it must
be late afternoon.</p>

<p>The door of the lean-to opened and two
masked men entered. The first one he knew
was the owner of the Diamond Dot, but the
second he could not identify.</p>

<p>Hack Cook bent down and looked at
Chuck’s throbbing head.</p>

<p>“He ain’t hurt much. Couple of days and
he’ll never know he was hit.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say he won’t,” put in the other rustler.
“In a couple of more days he’ll not care what
happens. I’m positive this kid and that Slim
Evans are cattle dicks.”</p>

<p>“We searched Meade but didn’t find a
thing,” replied Cook.</p>

<p>“Makes no difference. These boys are too
dangerous to have loose on the range. Why
Evans was within a few minutes of you when
you were riding in the foothills of the Three
Soldiers after you failed to bump off old man
Marks. If it hadn’t been for that rain, he’d
have gotten you sure.</p>

<p>“Another thing, he’s looking for a man that
rides a horse with a shoe that’s got a V-shaped
nick.”</p>

<p>“I fixed that,” growled Cook. “Had Doug
Huston file a nick on one of the shoes of
Meade’s horse and we filed a couple on the
horses of the other boys. Say, there’s so many
V-shaped nicks making tracks around this valley
that the fellow who tries to follow all of
them will go crazy.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s hope that Evans tries to follow
them all. That fellow’s just plain dynamite.”</p>

<p>Chuck was hungry and he spoke up.</p>

<p>“How about something to eat?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not tonight. We haven’t got any grub
with us. Maybe we’ll be back tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Then give me a drink.”</p>

<p>Cook laughed harshly. “It’ll do you good to
get thirsty. Give you an idea of what we’re
going to do with you when we have time.”</p>

<p>They stepped outside and slammed the door.
Chuck could hear them conversing outside.</p>

<p>“When are you going to ship the cattle?”
asked the unidentified rustler.</p>

<p>“Day after tomorrow. Can’t get cars until
then,” replied Cook.</p>

<p>“Well, keep a close eye on Meade. I’m going
back to Dirty Water. After the cattle are
safely out I’ll come back and we’ll decide just
how we’ll dispose of this fellow.”</p>

<p>They mounted their horses and rode rapidly
away, leaving Chuck alone, without food or
water. The air grew chill, and he spent a miserable
night.</p>

<p>It was mid morning when he heard a lone
rider coming toward the cabin. The horseman
dismounted and opened the door. Like the
visitors of the day before he was masked, but
he had a jug of water and some food. He untied
the ropes that bound Chuck’s hands and,
gun in hand, squatted on the other side of the
lean-to while Chuck wolfed the food. His lips
were cracked from lack of water and his stomach
ached with a great emptiness, but the
coarse food soon gave him new energy. If the
masked rustler would only come close enough
for him to lunge. Chuck eyed the distance
with a calculating eye.</p>

<p>“Turn around,” commanded the gunman.
Chuck was forced to obey, and the rope was
slipped over his hands again. The lean-to was
in semi-darkness and Chuck managed to tense
his hands. Perhaps there would be a little slack
when the rustler finished tying the knots.</p>

<p>Chuck was hurled over on his back and the
rustler slammed the door and rode away. It
was not until Chuck was sure that he was quite
alone again, that he renewed his attempt to
loosen his bonds. The rope around his wrists
gave slightly and he worked steadily, straining
against the bonds. Night came and in spite
of himself he fell asleep.</p>

<p>At dawn he was at the painful task again,
straining and tugging, and making a little
progress all of the time. At last his left hand
slipped free, then his right, and with shaking
fingers he untied the knots that had held his
legs fast.</p>

<p>His legs were so numb that he was forced to
crawl out of the lean-to on his hands and knees.
Once outside he rested in the bright sunlight,
blinking his eyes against the unaccustomed
light. He massaged the muscles of his legs until
the circulation was back to normal and then
he stood up. It was great to be free again.</p>

<p>At a nearby stream Chuck washed his face
and hands and gingerly felt of the wound on
his head. Nature had done a good job of healing
it and unless he got another severe bump,
it should heal all right.</p>

<p>Chuck took time to survey his prison. The
cabin and lean-to were in the heart of the
Cajons, an old trail leading away to the left. It
was along this that the rustlers who had visited
the cabin traveled. There appeared to be no
other exit from the valley and Chuck set out
along the trail, walking carefully.</p>

<p>For better than a mile he followed the winding
path. Then it opened suddenly into a wider
valley and Chuck looked down on the hiding
place of the rustlers of the Creeping Shadows.</p>

<p>There was plenty of water here and lots of
rich grass. A large pole corral had been built
near the far end of the valley where the mountains
closed in again. Down there was also a
large cabin. The whole valley appeared deserted
except for a calico cayuse which was in
a smaller corral. Chuck’s heart leaped as he
recognized his own horse.</p>

<p>Keeping under shelter as much as possible
he made his way down the valley. The entire
layout was deserted and he entered the cabin.
His saddle and rifle as well as six-gun were piled
against one wall and with eager hands Chuck
fastened the gun belt around his waist. There
was food in the cabin and he soon had a good
meal. Rifle in hand and saddle over one shoulder,
he started for the corral. Refreshed by the
food, he was ready to hit the road.</p>

<p>The dusty trail leading out of the larger corral
indicated that a small herd of cattle had
been driven out of it a short time before and
Chuck picked up the trail and followed it,
angling always a little to the left.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the smaller trail joined
the one Slim had followed through the mountains,
the path the rustlers used in running the
cattle out of the Creeping Shadows over to the
railroad. Chuck had stumbled on the hiding
place where they held the stolen livestock until
time to ship them out from the railroad.</p>

<p>Still following the trail of the cattle, Chuck
swung toward the railroad. He rode steadily,
ever watchful lest he run into another trap of
the rustlers. At noon he was well down the
east side of the Cajons and he saw the local
freight pulling down the main line and stop,
but he was still some miles away, too great a
distance to see what happened after the freight
stopped.</p>

<p>Chuck spurred his cayuse into a full gallop,
rocketing down out of the Cajon foothills.
The trail straightened out and a lone rider,
coming at a furious pace, came into sight.</p>

<p>Chuck swung his cayuse off the trail, slid
from the saddle, and found shelter behind a
rock. The oncoming rider had been too busy
looking behind him to see Chuck.</p>

<p>It was Hack Cook, owner of the Diamond
Dot. Then Slim galloped into view and Chuck
snuggled his cheek down against the butt of
his rifle and voted himself a large-sized share of
the chase.</p>

<p>Much as he knew the rustler deserved to be
shot down without mercy, Chuck couldn’t
quite bring himself to that. Lining his sights
on the oncoming rider, he pressed the trigger.
There was a tiny spurt of smoke from the rifle
and Hack Cook catapulted from the saddle,
drilled neatly through the right shoulder.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch23' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-Three</span><br /> <br />The Confession</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slim rode easily, keeping the fleeing owner of
the Diamond Dot within sight. They pushed
deeper into the Cajon foothills and Slim knew
that Cook’s horse would soon commence to
slow down under the pace, which was gruelling
for the average range horse.</p>

<p>In desperation Cook dismounted and unlimbered
his rifle but Slim, sensing the move
before the rustler had found cover, dropped
out of his saddle and fired rapidly at the Diamond
Dot man. Cook was beaten at his own
game and he leaped back into the saddle to continue
the race against certain capture.</p>

<p>If he could only hold out until nightfall
there was just a chance that he could escape,
but Slim had no intention of allowing the
rustler to do that. He was closing the gap
steadily when the trail opened into a long,
narrow defile in the mountains.</p>

<p>Cook spurred his tiring horse madly, while
Slim gave Lightning her head. It was a good
place to end the chase. He slipped his rifle out
of the scabbard and lined up the sights. Before
he could raise the weapon to his shoulder he saw
Cook topple from his saddle to lie motionless
along the trail.</p>

<p>Slim pulled Lightning up sharply. Perhaps
it was a trick of the rustler’s, a ruse to bring
him within sure range.</p>

<p>Slim dismounted and moved forward warily,
his rifle ready for instant use. Then the
echo of hoofs warned him of the approach of
another rider and up ahead Chuck burst into
view on his calico cayuse. It was then that
Slim knew Cook’s fall from the saddle was no
ruse. He had been shot down by Chuck, who
had suddenly voted himself a hand in the play.</p>

<p>The Flying Arrow cowboy was the first to
reach the wounded rustler. Cook was still
dazed from the shock of the wound and the
fall, but he was not seriously injured. Relieving
him of his weapons, Slim looked up just as
Chuck arrived in a thunder of drumming
hoofs and a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“Where under the sun did you come from?”
demanded the astonished Slim.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about that later. Did I get
that skunk?” Chuck pointed toward the
rustler.</p>

<p>“Through the right shoulder,” nodded Slim.
“If you hadn’t cut in on the play when you did,
I was figuring on stopping his travels in about
another second.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, but I owed him a little more than you
did. What’s happened since I did the disappearing
act?”</p>

<p>“We had a little fireworks along the railroad
this afternoon,” smiled Slim. “Seemed a half
dozen hombres were shipping some Box B cattle
under another name and we put a stop to it.”</p>

<p>“Did you get them all?”</p>

<p>“Counting Cook here, they’re all in the bag.”</p>

<p>“That must just about clean out the gang,”
said Chuck.</p>

<p>“There’s a few more, but we’ll round them
up in time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a score to settle with one of them,”
said Chuck, relating briefly how he had been
held captive. He was especially incensed at
his treatment at the hands of the masked man
who had accompanied Hack Cook on the visit
of the Diamond Dot owner to the hideout
where he had been held captive.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out who that fellow was,”
went on Chuck.</p>

<p>“I think I know,” put in Slim, “but if you
can get Cook to tell you, so much the better.”</p>

<p>They bent over the rustler, who was now
thoroughly aware of his dangerous situation.
Slim tore off a piece of Cook’s shirt and bound
up the shoulder wound.</p>

<p>“Give me a drink of water,” the rustler
begged.</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” snapped Chuck. “You
fellows didn’t treat me any too well. I want
to know the name of the hombre that was with
you.”</p>

<p>Cook’s face whitened, but his lips tensed and
he only shook his head.</p>

<p>“So that’s the way it is,” said Chuck grimly.
“Believe me, you’re going to talk.”</p>

<p>The Circle Four cowboy took the rope off
his saddle and deftly slipped a noose around
Cook’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” demanded
Slim, who wasn’t sure whether Chuck was in
earnest or was merely trying to scare the
rustler.</p>

<p>“I’m going to drag the information I want
out of this cheap desperado,” replied the cowboy
detective.</p>

<p>Chuck walked toward his horse, straightened
the rope out after him. Cook attempted to
free himself, but Chuck had done a neat job.</p>

<p>The Circle Four cowboy mounted his cayuse
and turned back to Cook.</p>

<p>“There’s one more chance. Who was with
you?”</p>

<p>Still the rustler’s lips were sealed and with a
warning glance at Slim not to interfere, Chuck
spoke to his horse. The cayuse moved ahead
and the rope tightened.</p>

<p>A startled cry broke from Cook’s lips.</p>

<p>“I’ll talk!” he screamed, “I’ll talk! Don’t
drag me over these rocks.”</p>

<p>Chuck dismounted.</p>

<p>“I thought it would work,” he grinned at
Slim. “This fellow’s yellow clear through.”</p>

<p>The cowboy detectives bent over Cook.</p>

<p>“Talk fast,” Chuck warned him. “If you
don’t I’ll take you for a real ride.”</p>

<p>Cook moistened his lips. It was plain that
he was reluctant to talk and only Chuck’s
threat of a terrible punishment had loosened his
tongue.</p>

<p>“It was Titzell,” he muttered. “Titzell got
us into this jam. He was too greedy. He
wanted everything.”</p>

<p>Slim looked at Chuck. He had been right.
Titzell was the leader of the rustlers. Disguised
as a cattle buyer, he had ridden the
length and breadth of the valley, spotting
choice stock to be run off by the gang later.</p>

<p>“Who else is in the gang?” insisted the relentless
Chuck.</p>

<p>“They’ll kill me if they learn I’ve squealed,”
begged Cook.</p>

<p>“If you don’t talk, they’ll never see you
again,” promised Slim.</p>

<p>“There’s Maxie Denkman and Leo Kovec
and Newt Bemis, besides the boys on my own
place.”</p>

<p>“How many have you got there?”</p>

<p>“Ten altogether, but you got four of them
and Newt Bemis when you jumped us at the
train.”</p>

<p>“That leaves six more Diamond Dot riders,
plus Maxie Denkman and the marshal at Dirty
Water,” said Slim. “Maxie’s out of the way,
because I put a slug in his elbow when he tried
that ambush on the Sky High trail.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the other six?” demanded Chuck.</p>

<p>“Two of the boys are watching the Sky High
trail, two of them are over on the trail through
the Three Soldiers and the last two are on the
trail from the valley south.”</p>

<p>“Think he’s telling the truth?” Chuck asked.</p>

<p>The tall cowboy nodded and walked over
and picked up Cook’s rifle. Calmly he fired a
bullet into the ground and then picked up the
spent shell. He produced another cartridge
from an inner pocket and compared the firing
pin marks on the base of the shell.</p>

<p>“I guess your days are numbered,” he told
Cook when he turned back. “The shell from
your gun corresponds exactly with one I found
at the scene of the ambush of Adam Marks and
your horse has the same V-shaped nick on the
left rear shoe.”</p>

<p>“There’s marks like that all over the range.
That don’t prove anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, it does. Remember that I’ll testify
I heard you and Titzell talking about that in
the cabin and you figured you were pretty
smart to file marks like that on a number of
shoes.”</p>

<p>Chuck’s words crushed the last resistance in
the rustler.</p>

<p>It was twilight when the first of the Box B
riders came up the trail. Pat Beals was ahead
and the cowboy detectives placed Hack Cook
in his hands for safekeeping.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” Pat demanded.</p>

<p>“To finish the job of cleaning up this gang of
rustlers,” said Slim. “We’ll see you tomorrow
sometime at the ranch.”</p>

<p>Before Pat could protest, Slim and Chuck
spurred away up the trail, determined to strike
fast and hard at the rest of the rustlers.</p>

<div>
<h2 id='ch24' class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-Four</span><br /> <br />Showdown</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The sky was clear that night and the trail
through the Cajons was easy to follow. They
stopped at the rustlers’ hideout and cooked a
late supper.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little errand to do,” said Chuck,
leaving the campfire. He mounted and disappeared
up the sidetrail. A few minutes later
Slim saw tongues of flame licking above the
tree tops. Chuck had set fire to the cabin
where he had been held captive.</p>

<p>Before they left, they got an axe from the
main cabin and chopped away the main poles of
the corral. Then, fastening ropes on the other
poles, they pulled the whole structure down.
Again a match was touched to the corral and
cabin and flames licked hungrily at the dry
wood.</p>

<p>“There’ll be no more use of this layout by
rustlers,” said Chuck grimly.</p>

<p>From then on they rode at an easy pace for
it was useless to attempt to reach Dirty Water
before morning. Stopping at the line camp,
they found Lee Wu keeping guard and the cook
rustled them an early breakfast.</p>

<p>They told him briefly of what had happened
at the railroad and how they had set fire to the
rustlers’ hideout.</p>

<p>“Plenty good,” the Chinaman grinned, giving
them extra portions of bacon. “Plenty
good.”</p>

<p>Before they left the line camp, Slim wrote a
note to Joe Haines. He had slipped badly, having
forgotten to tell Pat Beals that rustlers were
still stationed on three trails leading out of the
valley.</p>

<p>It was this information he left in the note,
urging Joe to send riders out at once to capture
the other rustlers.</p>

<p>Then Slim and Chuck pressed on. Dawn
found them nearing Dirty Water and the village
was just beginning to show signs of life
when they rode across the creek and tied their
horses at the rail in front of the Palace Hotel.</p>

<p>“They eat early here,” said Slim. “You stay
outside and be ready to take care of any of the
boys who decide to get away in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going into the hotel alone,” protested
Chuck.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do that very thing,” said Slim
with a definiteness that Chuck knew was final.
“I’m counting on you to discourage them if
they get outside. Remember, we want Hal
Titzell, Leo Kovec and Maxie Denkman.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember,” promised Chuck.</p>

<p>Slim looked up and down the street. Pike
Carberry and Jim Ferris were coming down
from Carberry’s store for breakfast at the hotel.
They greeted Slim cordially.</p>

<p>“Better not go in to breakfast just yet,” said
Slim.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Carberry.</p>

<p>“There may be trouble,” replied the cowboy
detective. “Just wait a bit.”</p>

<p>Jim Ferris looked around at Chuck, who was
lounging nearby with his rifle in his hands.</p>

<p>“He’s right,” he advised the storekeeper.
“I’ll be satisfied with cheese and crackers.
Come on.”</p>

<p>They turned and hurried back to the store
and Slim stepped into the small lobby of the
hotel. Sounds from the dining room indicated
that breakfast was in progress.</p>

<p>Slim took off his hat and pinned the small
shield that had been hidden there on his vest.
Then he walked into the dining room. There
were four men at the long table, the hotel
owner at the head with Hal Titzell at his right.
On the other side were Leo Kovec and Maxie
Denkman and Maxie, with his wounded arm,
was making a poor job of eating the hot cereal.</p>

<p>Titzell looked up as Slim entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, there. What’s the news from the
wide open spaces?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” said Slim easily. Then Titzell’s
eyes caught the gleam of the small shield on
Slim’s vest and the smile vanished. In its place
came an expression of repressed fury and alarm.</p>

<p>“Seems as though some of the Diamond Dot
boys were caught trying to ship some Box B
cattle yesterday afternoon,” said Slim.</p>

<p>Maxie Denkman sneezed into the cereal and
Leo Kovec let his fork drop with a clatter.</p>

<p>“Anybody hurt?” asked Titzell, his voice
low and tense.</p>

<p>“Plenty of the Diamond Dot boys and it
seems as though I recall seeing a friend of yours
being shot out of the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?” asked Maxie.</p>

<p>“Newt Bemis.” Slim’s eyes never left Titzell
for he knew that if there were to be fireworks,
Titzell would start the trouble.</p>

<p>But Titzell never batted an eye and Slim
gave him another shock.</p>

<p>“Hack Cook was taken, too. Hack talked.”</p>

<p>That touched off the fuse. Titzell knew
then that Slim had come to take him. With a
leap he was clear of the table, his right hand
sweeping toward the shoulder holster.</p>

<p>But Slim had anticipated the move. As Titzell
clawed the gun from his holster, the explosion
of Slim’s gun echoed through the hotel
and Titzell’s weapon spun across the room.</p>

<p>The hotel owner made a dive for safety beneath
his table while Leo Kovec plunged
through the window. Only Maxie Denkman
remained seated.</p>

<p>“I know when I’ve had enough,” he said.
“You can count me out.”</p>

<p>From outside came the report of a rifle and
Slim knew that Chuck had gone into action.
There was no answering shot and Slim figured
that Kovec would cause no more trouble.</p>

<p>Titzell was holding his right hand, numbed
by the shock of Slim’s bullet.</p>

<p>“Get outside,” commanded the cowboy detective
and Maxie followed Titzell out.</p>

<p>There they found that Chuck was sitting
astride Kovec, the marshal groveling in the
sand.</p>

<p>“I just took one shot at him,” Chuck
grinned, “and he thought he was hit sure.
Gosh, to think that I missed at only fifty
yards!”</p>

<p>Residents of Dirty Water crowded around
them, seeking an explanation, but Slim refused
to tell them what had taken place. Chuck
stood guard over the prisoners, while Slim went
around to the stable and ordered the hostler to
saddle three horses. A short time later the three
rustlers, with Slim and Chuck riding close behind,
started the journey to the Box B.</p>

<p>Titzell and Denkman were silent, but Kovec
talked volubly. He was scared to death and
Slim took advantage of this fear. From a saddle
bag he pulled the gun which Chuck had
found outside Doc Baldridge’s office the night
a second attempt had been made to kill the
owner of the Box B.</p>

<p>“Recognize this gun?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It belongs to Titzell. He said he lost it.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” The cattle buyer roared at
Kovec, but it was too late. Slim knew all that
was necessary. He had all of the evidence
needed to put Titzell and the Diamond Dot
riders behind the bars for a long, long time.</p>

<p>When they reached the Box B, they found
Bill Needham waiting to greet them.</p>

<p>“Great work, boys,” he said, as they rode up.
“You’ve certainly cleared out the rustlers in
the Creeping Shadows.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the evidence, but you’ll have to
prove the case in court against them,” said
Slim.</p>

<p>“I’ll do that all right,” said Old Bill. “I’ve
been talking with Hack Cook and he’s given
me a full account under oath. Titzell’s the big
gun in this whole thing. He came in when
Cook was just about ready to fold up and between
the two of them they figured that if
they could steal enough cattle and get the
Double O and the Box B fighting each other,
they’d have a good chance to step in and grab
both ranches cheap.”</p>

<p>Joe Haines came down from the ranch house.
“The boss wants to see you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Any of the Box B or Double O boys get
hurt much?” asked Slim.</p>

<p>“Al Bass has a flesh wound and so has another
one of the Double O riders and Doug Huston’s
disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, I should think he would,” said Chuck.
“He was hand in glove with this outfit. He
was the guy who roped Slim that night down
at the corral and left him tied up by the creek.
Doug kept the gang tipped off to everything
the Box B was doing.”</p>

<p>“You mean almost everything,” put in Slim.</p>

<p>They found Adam Marks almost recovered
and from him they received heartfelt thanks
for their fine work.</p>

<p>Nels Anderson was waiting for them outside.
“By gar, boys,” he roared. “Anytime you
need help, just let Nels know. I’ll come
a-runnin’.”</p>

<p>Box B and Double O riders had gone out
to round up the last of the rustlers who had
been guarding the main trails into the valley
and the end was rapidly being written on the
feud which had threatened for a time to disrupt
the entire valley. There was nothing
more that Slim and Chuck needed to do and
after a hearty dinner at the cookhouse, where
Lee Wu was once more presiding over the pots
and pans, they mounted and rode down the
trail toward Dirty Water. Behind them they
left the shouted farewells of the Box B and
Double O cowboys and a promise from Bill
Needham that he would call on them again
when a knotty mystery confronted him.</p>

<p>They circled Dirty Water, for they had no
desire to give a long explanation of their activities,
and continued on toward the Sky High
trail. A few miles further on they met Walt
Kelly and a Double O rider coming down with
the two rustlers who had been stationed to
guard the trail. The way in and out of the
valley was open once more.</p>

<p>By sundown they were well along the trail.
Turning in their saddles they looked back on
the Creeping Shadows country. Night was
already stealing out of the majestic valleys of
the Three Soldiers and peace once more ruled
the valley.</p>

<p>They turned their horses up the trail, wondering
what new adventures might be in store
for them with the coming days.</p>
